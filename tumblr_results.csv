I went to the club. I decided to use this as a pre-trial before next weekends big rave! I went with friends that don’t drink and that know about my recovery. I had a blast!!!! I LOVE and have missed dancing and EDM music so much! I had no cravings to drink tonight! I was so focused on having fun with my friends!</p><p>Things I noticed that I’ve never noticed before while dancing sober:</p><p>- I dance better sober</p><p>- The lights and fog machines are so fun to watch</p><p>- the music sounds better </p><p>- drunk people look so&hellip; turned off. they look totally weird. I felt so alive compared to them. </p><p>- drunk people are annoying. they spill their drinks all over the place.. they flail around and fall down. </p><p>Honestly I was so turned off of alcohol tonight just watching the drunk people all around me. I watched a young lady puke all over the sidewalk and watched the police pull up and drive her off to the drunk tank. Most of the people will wake up dehydrated and extremely hungover. Wondering how they ended up in a stranger’s bed. Regretting how much money they spent and the foolish choices that were made. </p><p>Tonight made me SOOO thankful to be sober. I will wake up with no hangover ready to face another day! Thank you God for allowing me to experience sobriety! </p>"

<p>I got my second injection yesterday. The injection is supposed to help with alcohol cravings and if you do drink, you won&rsquo;t get that same buzz feeling. </p>

<p>I think for the most part it does help but once it starts to wear off, I&rsquo;ve noticed my cravings increase. I have to be careful during this time because I notice I seek other ways to fill that void that I felt alcohol filled when I was actively using.</p>

<p>I just have to keep at it. One day at a time.</p>"

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 1:  </strong>We admitted we were powerless over our Chinese food addiction – that our lives had become unmanageable<em>, though our lives have become extraordinarily delicious.  And nutritious!</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;""><strong>STEP 2:  </strong>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. </span><em style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"">That along with the 20% of coupons we periodically receive in the mail and what we find online.</em></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 3:  </strong>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of the Chinese Chef-God as we understood Chinese Chef-God.  <em>Oh mighty Chef, how we put our trust, and our palates, in thee.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 4:  </strong>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves<em>, through a thorough reading of your menus, and through personal requests, neigh, pleas, to your extraordinary culinary talents.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 5:  </strong>Admitted to the Chinese Chef-God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs<em>… and then invited them to dine with us.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 6:  </strong>We are entirely ready to have the Chinese Chef-God remove all these defects of character.  <em>For, as we all know, an hour from now we’d be hungry again anyways, and there would be no one around then to stop us from gorging our bulging tummies from yet another gastronomical orgy.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 7:  </strong>Humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings. <em>And our dirty, empty, plates, so we can fill them once again with more of your Chinese Chef-God offerings, which we eagerly, and hungrily, accept.  And devour!</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 8:  </strong>Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all<em>… by inviting them to break bread with us on our next Chinese Quest!</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 9:  </strong>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others<em>… especially if they were full.  Or, morbidly obese.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 10:  </strong>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.  <em>I admit it.  I have a fever and there’s only one cure.  I gotta have more Chinese food!</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 11:  </strong>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with Chinese Chef-God as we understood Chinese Chef-God, praying only for knowledge of God’s will for us and the power to carry that out. <em> Ommmmmmay I have some more, please?</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>STEP 12:  </strong>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to other Chinese food addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.  <em>The message is clear.  You must share this URL:  <a href=""http://www.thechinesequest.com"">http://www.thechinesequest.com</a> with everyone in your address book.  You must insist that they subscribe to the blog; and, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thechinesequest"" target=""_blank"">LIKE them on Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/thechinesequest"" target=""_blank"">FOLLOW them on Twitter</a>, and post comments, as penance, on every article read on said blog.  </em></span></p>

I have 1 tattoo on my left shoulder. That tattoo means a lot to me. It represents my life story and my faith story. The tattoo is not complete and eventually I will add more to it. But today I got a tattoo to cover up some scars on my lower arm. I self-harmed as a child and I have always hated the scars that remained. So I designed a tattoo that would cover both the scars. The tattoo is of a stag and its entwined with a rose. The deer represents my Cree name and a favorite bible verse, <i>“He makes me like the deer that does not stumble, He helps me stand on the steep mountains” Psalm 18:33.</i> The rose reminds how beautiful and rare it is to exist. The design took me about 2 years to complete from the idea to the finished design. </p><p>Today was a healing day for me. The excitement of getting a tattoo took my mind off of my family and the death of my uncle. It was healing for me to watch as the ugly scars began to disappear under my design and the ink. My arm is actually quite sore right now but this pain is nothing compared to the pain I felt as a child when I marred my body with that razor. I feel a little more hopeful today and I realized how important my sobriety is to me. One day at a time!</p>"

Disease is usually a binary system: either you&rsquo;ve got it or you don&rsquo;t. Pneumonia: got it or you don&rsquo;t. HIV: got it or you don&rsquo;t. Multiple sclerosis, polio, emphysema–all of these are yes-or-no propositions. But alcoholism is not, in fact, a disease: it is a behavior, or perhaps a collection of behaviors. And because nobody can say for sure whether a behavior has ever been eliminated for good without a crystal ball, we must first establish a baseline definition of what success looks like in the treatment of addiction. I&rsquo;ll propose this simple definition: </p>

Our relationships were based solely on getting high or drinking together.</p><p><b>2) Allow myself to grieve.</b> I have a disease. Its called alcoholism. Its cunning baffling and powerful. Holding in my anger towards myself would not help me to heal from the pain I had been through.</p><p><b>3) I had to reach out for help. </b>The night I ended up in the hospital I was told i should seek help in the form of therapy. The following week I attended my first AA meeting. I also set up an appointment to see an addictions counselor. </p><p><b>4) Go to Alcoholics Anonymous.</b> AA seriously has helped save my life. I found a temporary sponsor who then became my permanent sponsor. She was there for me when I was suffering withdrawals and going through cravings. And she is still there for me today. I can call her anytime when I am struggling or just need someone to listen to me. She has been through what I am going through and she offers me insights and wisdom to guide me through the difficult times. She is helping me work through the 12 step program and encourages me all the time!</p><p><b>5) Find a safe place to live.</b> My last housing situation was a toxic environment in many ways. I was told I needed to move out and today I am thankful for the way things have worked out. I live in an alcohol free home. </p><p>This last one is completely optional but for me personally it has helped save my life.</p><p><b>6) Let friends and family know about your recovery. </b>I have allowed my friends and family to journey beside me as I recover and learn to live in sobriety. They encourage me and I am so thankful to have their support. Allowing them to know about my sobriety has allowed me to be completely honest with them and it holds me accountable to continue on with my sobriety. </p><p>Yours truly and in honesty, </p><p>Soberslothling (

Pt 1","<p>Two days after I ended up in hospital due to alcohol poisoning my mother came to my house to talk to me about what happened. At this point I still was very ill and in a fog from the alcohol. I don’t remember much about her visit other than her asking me, <i>“<b>what do we do now?”</b> </i>We discussed a plan of action which included her contacting someone from AA. It also involved me agreeing to stay sober for that day.<i> </i>I remember getting out of moms car after her visit and walking into the house and seriously contemplating walking a few blocks to the off-sale and grabbing a bottle of vodka. My entire being was shaken. My mom had made me realize two things:</p><p>1) My family was seriously concerned about me </p><p>2) I may have a slight drinking problem. I spent that weekend suffering awful withdrawals and crying&hellip; alot!</p><p>But on October 5, 2015 at 11:14 am I decided to reach out and contact the number that had been given to me for a ride to AA. My thinking was: I will go to one meeting and get my parents off my back about AA and maybe this whole thing will go away. I was shaking when my ride arrived that evening. I really don’t remember much about that first meeting. I do know that I was scared of criticism and afraid that someone would recognize me. But I was met with smiling faces and kindness. I was welcomed in and given a newcomers package. Everything that was said in that meeting was meant for me. By the end of it I knew full well that I was an alcoholic. </p>"

I went through my day with a smile on my face. I attended my AA meeting and was encouraged. There were several newcomers and I could see the fear and pain in their eyes.

I went straight for stage 2 and 3. I never drank responsibly. I <i>thought </i>I was a “responsible drinker.” I thought getting drunk was the right way to drink. Anybody that left a drink half finished or only had a glass didn’t know how to drink! I always thought what a waste! Why bother drinking alcohol if your not going to get drunk. At parties there were times when I would only have 1 drink because I know that it was not a “lets get hammered” party. But afterwards on the way home I would stop at the liquor store and pick up some booze because 1 drink would leave me craving for more. I could never just have 1. There were also times I was tired and didn’t feel like partying. But I knew as soon as I drank 1 or 2 drinks that feeling would disappear!</p><p>Stage 4 happened soon after I moved out of my parents house fall of 2013. I was independent, I could drink whenever I wanted to! I was working full-time day job and you could definitely say I was a functional alcoholic. I worked a Monday- Friday 9-6 retail position. I hated that job. My boss was unfair and overworked all of his employees. So… to cope I would work my 8 hour shift then walk 45 minutes back to my condo and pull out one of several 2L 7% coolers I had purchased at the beginning of the week and proceed to drink the whole thing. By 10 o’clock pm i was good and drunk and then would pass out. I did this so many times. I didn’t always do this, I had access to other “medications.” Marijuana was my other drug of choice, so when the booze ran out Mary Jane backed me up. So I worked this really shitty day job during the week, but it was my weekend job that was what kept me going. Sort of. I was (at the time) the ONLY female DJ in my city and I was soon discovered and signed to a label. I worked as a opener DJ at one of the nightclubs. Perks of being a DJ: FREE ALCOHOL!!!!! So I was drunk most weekends. Sobering up by Sunday evening so I could be somewhat alive for Monday. Some mornings I NEEDED a shot of booze to get me going. This is when stage 4 definitely kicked in. I drank hard until the end of May 2014 when I was taken by ambulance to the hospital. I spent that summer in and out of hospital. </p><p>By early fall of 2014 I was well into stage 5: addiction. I had just come through a summer of horrible illness (I may make a post about that later). I had gotten addicted to morphine while in the hospital. (I went a full 18 days without alcohol from July 15 to August 2nd, but I had morphine so definitely wasn’t sober. I would ask the the nurse for pain med’s even when I didn’t have pain, to deal with my alcohol withdrawal. Doctors did not know at this time that I was an alcoholic). I bought alcohol the first day I was released out of hospital to “celebrate.” By October 1st I had been completely weaned off of morphine and had T3′s to cover any “extra pain” that I might experience. Well those were probably gone within a week. And by November 2014 I was drinking just as much as I had been before I got sick. I was no longer a “functioning alcoholic.” I was living on Employment Insurance and told not to return to work until 2015. I didn’t end up getting a part time job until April of 2015. At this time I moved in with a friend and slowed my drinking to only drinking on the weekends. It was after I got fired from my part-time job that I started spiraling out of control. </p><p>Summer of 2015 was spent drinking and drugging. I partied hard on weekends and drank during the week because I was living on welfare and had nothing better to do. I went hungry so that I could drink. I lied to and manipulated my friends so that I could drink. I was in debt so that I could drink. I compromised my health so that I could feed my disease.  </p><p>Today is February 22, 2016. Today I am 4 months and 21 days sober. I have food in my cupboards and fridge. I am rebuilding the relationships I had damaged. I am no longer in debt. And my health is slowly returning. I’m working my 12 step program and discovering who I am. Sobriety is giving me my life back. Addiction was leading me to my grave. Every day is different. Some days are horrible and it makes me want to relapse. I’m not perfect  but today I am sober and that’s what counts. </p><p>Yours Truly and in Honesty,</p><p>Soberslothling</p>"

However, she makes an effort to hang out with me, so I have to assume that she actually enjoys my company. </p><p>A lot of women in the program have become really good friends.

Why stay clean and sober? The answer is clear for me; sobriety is the better way. It’s not the easiest way, but anything in life that is worth anything requires some amount of work. Sobriety isn’t any different. It’s hard at times to not give into my obsessive thinking over a drink when the urge charms its way into my mind. I know when I was drinking until blacked out, or passed out, nothing in my life was going the way I wanted; nothing positive was occurring in my life. Addiction is progressive and starts out innocent, but it ALWAYS ends up robbing a person of everything he/she has including life. I lost a lot when I was in addictive addiction. <br/>My sobriety, thus far, has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I numbed all of my emotions when I drank and now that the bottle is gone I am left to deal with my emotions. My emotions and mind can be a scary place. Slowly but surely things come together. <br/> For the most part, sobriety has and still is treating me very good. It is the easier softer way. In sobriety I am learning to fall in love with myself and discovering myself on the most intimate level-the spiritual level. The result is myself starting to love and enjoy my life. I know if I pick up a drink nothing will change overnight, but the problem is I will continue to drink; the end result will not be pretty. I read a quote somewhere that went kind of like this, “create a life you want, so you don’t need to use drugs or alcohol.” I came to believe this is true for me. My goal is to experience all that I can before I die. If I’m drinking I won’t accomplish anything or experience the great pleasures this life has to offer. <br/>Sobriety is the hardest thing I had and continue to do, but it is well worth it. <br/></p>"

We started chatting and she said she was newly sober, etc. We grew friendly, but soon she stopped going to meetings and responding to my texts. Last night I saw her and I asked her how she was. She admitted she was struggling with sobriety - her latest streak was less than a week. She asked, “How long have you been sober?” I proudly told her “November 6.” </p><p>She seemed really surprised and a tad envious. She asked me how I managed it because she was struggling. I told her that my sobriety allowed me to have all sorts of other great things - a wonderful, caring boyfriend, a healthier bank account, energy to do schoolwork. Once I realized that I stopped thinking about drinking because drinking would absolutely destroy that. </p><p>I hugged her and told her I hoped to see her next week. </p><p>Sometimes I feel annoyed or frustrated that I only have 108 days. If I hadn’t relapsed, I’d have six months. However, when I look at other people who haven’t been able to string together more than a week, I realize how lucky I am. Sure, this isn’t as impressive as those with years, but it’s still pretty cool. </p>"

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a streak of doing really well and putting my life together. And then today my fibro acts up. I have to use the cane. It bothers me because I was doing so well and haven&rsquo;t used it in about 3 weeks because my pain has been manageable.</p>

<p>I had a client today who was upset because he wasn&rsquo;t getting what he wanted; that he wanted things his way. I tried explaining to him about the director in the AA big book, and how no matter how they tried, the play wouldn&rsquo;t look the way they wanted it to be and the players/actors would start to be angry and even quit. Of course, my client being in the pre-contemplative stage, didn&rsquo;t seem to have this stick.</p>

<p>But I realize that I have to remind myself this on a DAILY BASIS. I can&rsquo;t have good pain days all the time. I can&rsquo;t get what I want right away; the big things take time and I need to work on them. I want Chris and Liam to move in so badly so we can be a family, because I love them. And they motivate me to do better in my life by looking at the future and having these gifts. BUT some promises will come SLOWLY; I cannot force things to happen like I used to when I was drinking or else they will fall apart. </p>

<p>And I also cannot let my negative thinking get the best of me in terms of my fibro. Yeah, it was a bad pain day: I could have called out of work and be miserable because I was in pain. But I did something about it. I DID go to work today. I did accomplish things around the house like cooking and answering MIM questions. It is how I make out of the situation: I can be in pain and nope, or I can do something about it and do my best.</p>

<p>Overall though, life is great and coming together. My job is not okay and is always negative, BUT I have an interview for a clinical position in a family based program next Thursday. It&rsquo;s kind of like my internship back in the day but it&rsquo;s community based instead of a residential program. Which is good; work is just getting stressful and I&rsquo;m not doing what I want to be doing: which is therapy. This can also help me make more money and move into a bigger place in my apartment complex. And settle down/have a stable life. Because that&rsquo;s what I want. And I have been getting bits and pieces of it. I love it. That&rsquo;s what I have wanted in life&hellip;other than my private practice. Lol.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m going to be a MIM mod and answer more questions. Then sleeeeeep.</p>"

<p>I am finding it easier to cope without the alcohol, though I do have my slips. Most days I am able to maintain sobriety. So I am thankful for that. </p>

I had no idea where I was or how I got there. I would later find out that paramedics were called to our house because I wasn’t breathing and was barely responsive, my friends were scared I wasn’t going to make it. The rest I don’t remember and I really don’t want to know. I spent that night in emergency, I had somewhat severe alcohol poisoning. I woke up the next morning still kinda drunk and in pain. My gut hurt from the activated charcoal they gave me to make me vomit and my head hurt from dehydration. The doctor warned me that I needed to be careful, and that I should probably seek help from a therapist. After that I was allowed to leave.</p><p>Thus began one of the hardest month of my life. The first few days of sobriety were absolute hell! I spent most of it sleeping, crying and puking. My friends and family were asking me to get help because I had a drinking problem. So I did. I started attending AA. I was so terrified the first time I went. But I found the people at AA to be so kind, and understanding. They knew how I felt because they had stood in my place before. They encouraged me to continue attending and taking it one day at a time. </p><p>Sobriety has not been easy. I fought for each day and continue to do so. I kept in touch with my sponsor and kept attending meetings. I had lied to cover up my pain and I ended up hurting a lot of people. But being sober has helped me slowly rebuild some of those relationships. I am learning to have fun without alcohol, I’m starting to discover who I am. Sobriety has given me hope, new healthy memories, gratitude and is slowly bringing me back to my faith. I still have a long ways to go. But I go to sleep at night at peace with myself. I am not perfect but I know that I am valued, loved and worth being known. Today I am 139 days sober.</p>"

I was bound so tightly by chains of mistrust, guilt, and trauma. I drank because I couldn’t bear to deal with the pain that had been brought upon me. Alcohol made me free. Or so I thought. I thought binge drinking every weekend to the point of blackout was a good time. Waking up the next morning still drunk or extremely hungover meant the night before had been awesome regardless of whether or not i remembered what happened. </p><p>In reality my body was reeling and suffering badly from the poison flowing through my veins. I would find myself suffering withdrawals aka the 3 day long hangover. At some point during the week I would make the drive to the liquor store. I had several favorite places and those places came to know me as a regular customer. It was to the point where I wouldn’t get ID’d anymore because the store clerks knew who I was. I would often grab a 26 of flavored vodka because that was the fastest way to get alcohol into my system and a case of twisted teas to keep the buzz going for as long as possible. </p><p>I was so sick. My body couldn’t regulate a proper temperature, so I was either freezing or over heating. I was getting awful stomachaches because the lining of my stomach was damaged due to alcohol. I thought alcohol was my friend. It gave me something to do when I was bored. It gave me a good time and turned me into a laughing goofball at parties! My friends thought I was funny and that our drunken memories were the best! </p><p>I thought life was good, little did I know that I was horribly sick. I had this disease and it was slowly killing me. It had me gripped so tight that on September 30, 2015 I stopped breathing.  </p>"

It concluded in me completing <b><i>step 1: We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.</i></b></p><p>My life had indeed become unmanageable. I was binge drinking every weekend and drinking most of the week only sobering up to drive to the liquor store to buy more alcohol (I thought I was a responsible drinker LOL). I wasn’t eating properly and my health was quickly declining. My roommate would come home to find me in bed sleeping (I was prob passed out), Thinking that my iron was low or I just was under the weather. I had everyone fooled that I was perfectly okay and that nothing was wrong. When in actuality I was a spiraling raging alcoholic who didn’t accept that I had a drinking problem. But tonight I know that i am an alcoholic. But as I’ve said before alcoholism does not define who I am. God does. </p><p>Which brings us to <i><b>step 2: Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity</b>. </i>I didn’t think I’d ever make it to step 2. But hey I didn’t think I would ever make it to 137 days sober either. Amazing what sobriety can bring on! Happy 24 to ya’ll. One day at a time. </p>"

I’ve always had a short fuse but as a teen I was able to suppress it and work through it. As an alcoholic I would get into physical fights and take my anger out on the person who instigated me. I have scars and I’ve cracked knuckles from some of the fights I’ve been in. Just even thinking back to that makes me cringe. More often than not I was protecting myself or a buddy and was never found at fault for anything. Had I not been drinking I would have never found myself in those awful situations and would not bear the scars that are now on my hands. But I can see those scars in a new light, they can remind and help push me forward in my sobriety. I hope I never have to physically defend myself again. </p><p>I am thankful for the peace and calm I am learning to embrace! 137 days sober.</p>"

but not my torn vocal chords.<br/>
You show the ocean<br/>
but not the men who breathe its water.</p><p>Dear God of Maps,<br/>
oh, how you misdirect me, misguide me.<br/>
Whenever I follow you<br/>
I find myself in the wrong places:<br/>
in the wrong state, the wrong forest;<br/>
in the wrong toilet stall of the wrong bar;<br/>
in the pit of the wrong heart.</p><p>Forgive me,<br/>
I only use the maps I have drawn myself.<br/>
My hands are not steady, especially on Thursdays,<br/>
When I pass temples of neon lights and stained ceilings.<br/><br/>
Dear God of Maps,<br/>
I find myself alone<br/>
whenever I use the same map<br/>
to discover a new landscape.<br/>
I used a map of Colorado<br/>
to drive across Wyoming.<br/>
I used the map of one lover<br/>
to explore the countryside of another.</p><p>Dear God of Maps,<br/>
you have shown me<br/>
how your incarnations are short
stories:<br/>
Maps of valleys are stories of separation.<br/>
Maps of rivers, stories of loss.<br/>
Maps of oceans, mysteries<br/>
Maps of mountains, love stories.</p><p>When I found fists crushed against my cheekbones.<br/>
I thought he was drawing a map of rage<br/>
into my face.<br/>
I understand now.<br/>
He was pressing the four love stories of his knuckles<br/>
repeatedly into the parchment of my skin.<br/>
The valleys between his handbones<br/>
met the rivers of my cheeks.<br/>
Maps of deep oceans<br/>
all over my body.</p><p>I understand now.<br/>
He was trying to give me bearing.<br/>
Whenever we’re in the same room, now,<br/>
I know the direction<br/>
to every emergency exit.</p><p>I forgive him,<br/>
the same way you’ll forgive me<br/>
for being a lost cartographer,<br/>
a mapmaker without a compass.<br/>
I pray to you,<br/>
Dear God of Maps,<br/>
to stay hidden,<br/>
to conceal yourself from me<br/>
so that I may never find you,</p><p>Amen.</p><p> <br/><br/>More poems and prayers at <a href=""http://graypoetry.com/515-happy-hour-sobriety-prayer-book-god-of-maps/"">graypoetry.com</a></p>"

I don’t have to fear going to events i enjoy because of the alcohol or drugs. Yes there is definitely temptation, however I realized bringing a close friend who knows about my recovery would help me be accountable to myself!

Grabbing a 6 pack for a party was something to look forward to. I really do miss parties and going dancing. So when did it become an addiction? If I’m honest I can say I was addicted from the first time I got drunk. Its in my genetics and I was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Both my maternal and paternal grandparents were alcoholics and both of my parents were alcoholics, I lost my dad to his drug addiction and mental illness caused by drug abuse. and now I found out that my mom has been hospitalized recently due to her liver starting to shut down because of her alcohol abuse. I have 10 biological siblings  and 8 of those siblings struggle with addiction.</p><p>And then there is me. i was removed from my substance abusing family and put into a beautiful foster family when I was a baby. This family would raise me as a proper young christian woman. I had everything I wanted; a beautiful home with loving parents, two amazing older brothers, many pets and many good friends. So what happened? Several things happened. Major open heart surgery at age 17 that was supposed to fix me and make my heart stronger. The result was so much physical pain and my confidence was shattered. I was fit and healthy and I was never able to achieve the same thing. I had this big ugly 8 inch long scar running down my chest and I gained a bunch of weight. Real great when a girl wants to go grad dress shopping for her gr 12 graduation. That is also when fate decided I would meet my older biological brother. The summer after grad he spiked my drink as a joke and that was the first time I got drunk. I loved it. I felt free and happy. It took away any pain I had or felt both physically and emotionally. I became an alcoholic. No I don’t blame my brother for spiking my drink, once I discovered it was in there I was the one that chose to continue drinking just to see what would happen. It was MY choice. And now I am 24 years old and 130 days sober!</p>"

One is that AA was very interesting and helpful to me when I attended meetings in 1995 because it was comforting to see other alcoholics and to see how people who were so different could come together and express feelings and experiences that were so intimately similar.</p>

<p>But I don’t believe AA was useful in achieving or maintaining sobriety. It was interesting and comforting, but not of any particular use.</p>

<p>It’s important to understand what AA actually is. It’s not a company or an organization with a structure like that Salvation Army or Weight Watchers. It’s really composed of individuals who agree to meet at a certain place and at a certain time to listen to members discuss their experiences as drinkers and detail the problems alcohol has caused in their lives. Considering the lack of any staff or even chain of command, the meetings are remarkably similar and structured. Multibillion-dollar retail chains suffer less consistency,</p>

<p>But woven into the philosophy of AA are certain concepts that I feel undermine sobriety. The first is the requirement that one admit to powerlessness over alcohol. And probably, this is – along with the spiritual “higher power” aspect – one of the more frequent struggling points for those new to AA.</p>

<p>My problem with admitting to powerlessness over alcoholism is that it isn’t true. It was always a choice, though in the very late stage of my alcoholism, I made the choice by rote, never even considering the option not to drink. By then, it was extremely uncomfortable to be sober. Physically and mentally horribly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I actually think one must assume power in order to be sober. One must not give oneself the permission to drink or relapse that the powerlessness of being alcohol’s victim provides.</p>

<p>Another Feature of AA is its slogans. Some, like “What you focus on grows,” are profound to a cosmological degree.</p>

<p>Others, however, I believe encourage drinking. “Progress, not perfection” and “relapse is a part of recovery” are two such slogans.</p>

<p>AA is based on submission and humility and for this reason, alcoholics keep count of the number of days, then weeks, then months, then years, they have maintained their sobriety. As with all things in which there is a score, these numbers evolve meaning. Reaching a certain number is rewarded with a token; relapsing results in forfeiting all of one’s accumulated days and starting the count from zero again.</p>

<p>What I don’t like about this is that the score keeping introduces an unnecessary and potentially dangerous element of currency into sobriety.</p>

<p>In a program based on printed text – twelve steps, printed onto posters and hung on every wall of every AA meeting worldwide – and slogans, known to most members, and frequently utilized in meetings, a statement such as, “relapse is part of recovery’ becomes something close to an instruction. But if falling short of this, it certainly implies that a lack of relapse would be out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>So in a way, on exists within AA knowing they will at some point drink again because to not drink would be “perfection” and to drink would be a “relapse” and “part of recovery.” The price paid would be the number of days one was willing to lose.</p>

<p>All of this is a great deal of time spent in the company of alcohol, even if one isn’t consuming the stuff. Drinking alcohol with your mind isn’t freedom.</p>

<p>Talking about alcohol every day when you can’t drink isn’t going to work for everyone.</p>

<p>For this reason, AA strikes me not as the cure for alcoholism, but as the next best thing to drinking and the place to bide your time safely and without judgement until you do.</p>

<p>What has worked for me is to find something I wanted more than I wanted to drink, which was a fuck of a lot.</p>

<p>This is less a decision than a discovery. And it’s for this reason that not everybody will get sober.</p>

<p>My view that the way to stop drinking is to stop drinking is laughably simplistic on the surface. It’s “Just say no.”</p>

<p>It’s also true. The way to stop drinking is to want sobriety more. And then when you feel a craving, feel the craving until it passes. But don’t act on it – any more than you wouldn’t kill somebody you feel like killing when they cut you off in traffic.</p>

<p>Just because you want something, doesn’t mean you have to have it.</p>

<p>I know how infuriating that is to hear.</p>

<p>Relapse is the temper tantrum you allow yourself to have when you forbid yourself from drinking.</p>

<p>To stop drinking, you stop drinking. You pour it out right now.</p>

<p>Everything else – all the books, therapies, and programs – are merely hand-holding. They all strike to accomplish the same thing: to talk you into not drinking.</p>

<p>I’m saying, if you want to stop, you will. But most do not want to stop enough to actually stop. And until there’s a medical fix, alcoholics will die as drunks.</p>

<p>To be successful at not drinking, a person needs to occupy the space in life drinking once filled with something more rewarding than the comfort and escape of alcohol. This is the thing you have to find.</p>

<p>You might not. Most alcoholics won’t.</p>

<p>The truth is that people who cannot stop drinking are the people who, however guilty they may feel and however dire the consequences, have become so addicted to the drug and the experience that they prefer it to the remainder of their lives. While they may truly want to be sober, they want to drink more.</p>

<p>The thought that precedes a relapse – certainly in my case and I bet in others as well – is, “screw it.” Screw it is an idiom that means, “I no longer care.”</p>

<p>Taking a drink is the opposite of powerlessness. It is taking firm, decisive action to terminate a state of sobriety that feels less satisfying and less convincing than drinking has felt in the past or we imagine will feel in the present. It may feel like one is powerless because it’s frustrating to be unable to authentically want the thing you really want to want. But don’t.</p>

<p>As a drug, alcohol is cunning. Because most alcoholics do have a measure of control over their drinking, often for many years. This changes, when it does, suddenly and profoundly. In late-stage alcoholism, the physical effects from abstinence are not only painfully uncomfortable but they can be fatal. At this stage, the alcoholic requires alcohol.</p>

<p>AA advertises a majority success rate. The advertisement is in the form of one of AA’s foundation documents. “Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.” The implied efficacy brings to mind the question of, “who’s ‘we’?”</p>

<p>The twelve-step program is frequently the first and primary course of treatment administered for a diagnosis of alcoholism, which is medically classified as a disease. I can think of no other standard medical treatment that is supported by little or no research and offers patients no statistical information regarding efficacy.</p>

<p>Still, many people swear by AA and have maintained lengthy periods of sobriety within it. For these people, the spiritual foundation and community of AA provide something that is, on the whole, more satisfying for them than drinking.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that AA has “kept” these people sober. They have, instead, found something that has enabled them to choose a life without drinking. Many members of AA credit the program with keeping them sober; but they themselves are the reason.</p>

<p>They myth that alcoholics are powerless and unable in any way to shape the outcome of their addiction is a fatal, deeply untruthful message. No alcoholic should ever feel powerless over alcohol.</p>

<p>Those who die were not powerless. They either chose alcohol or they slid passively into the inevitable outcome of drinking; they made a decision by choosing to take no new action. And it’s this choice that results in death.</p>

<p>That there exists a medically recognized disease that is typically treated through twelve-step programs that are based on vague supernatural components is shocking to me. If breast cancer or leukaemia were treated in such a medieval fashion, there would be riots.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the treatment for addiction – until and if there is a successful medication – resides within the addict. You can’t spend time waiting for rehab to ‘work’ or for something to ‘fix’ you. These things can – and do – inspire you or encourage you. </p>

<p>You don’t need to take action to stop drinking. Drinking is an action: pouring the vodka into the glass, raising the glass to your lips. <br/>

To stop drinking, all you have to do is sit. <br/>

In 100 percent of the documented cases of alcoholism worldwide, the people who recovered all shared one thing in common, no matter how they did it:<br/>

They didn’t do it.</p>

<p>They just didn’t do it.</p>

<p>You absolutely can stop drinking today, right now.</p>

<p>The question is only, do you want to be sober more than you want to drink? Very few people can answer this question truthfully and reply, yes. </p>

<p>I hope you’re one of them. Maybe you are. </p>

<p>I didn’t think I was. </p>

<p>Now I didn’t get to share at this meeting but the one thing that I’m grateful for is to be a recovering alcoholic.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for those hangovers.<br/>
I’m grateful for those drunken fights.<br/>
I’m grateful for those broken relationships.<br/>
I’m grateful for those lost jobs.<br/>
I’m grateful for financial ruin.<br/>
I’m grateful for losing absolutely everything.</p>

<p>Because it brought to this point in my life. 
It brought me down to me knees where I asked my higher power for help. 
It brought me to rehab. 
It brought me to relapse. 
It brought me the courage to keep trying and to keep fighting for sobriety.</p>

<p>It taught me how to treat myself right. 
How to treat others right. 
How to forgive. 
How to let go. 
How to begin to change. 
How to not only just survive but to live.</p>

<p>I think those who are in recovery…in any kind of recovery…are so fortunate. Because we get a second chance at life. To do it right the second time around. Not many people get that. </p>

<p>And for that reason, I appreciate things more today. I’m happier today. I’m clear headed today. I’m wiser today. I’m stronger today. I love deeper today.</p>

<p>Marriage of two recovering addicts:</p>

<p>“The hardest thing for an addict to control?  Letting go of control!  And, for those of us fortunate enough to love another addict…that task can be evermore…daunting!</p>
<p>Things that bother me the most?  Knowing there is an addict in my own house…refusing help.</p>
<p>The Serenity Prayer in regards to loving an addict?  It’s understanding that I cannot control others.</p>
<p>How does a marriage between two addicts in recovery work?  I suppose it is believing that I can be there when her hand reaches out…With no questions asked!”</p>

It was absolutely needed and I&rsquo;m so relieved I did it. It’s obvious I have no control over my life and my drinking, it’s just so out of hand. I can’t stop for a week, and it always ends up in a binge that can stretch for days. It’s so scary, I have so much to lose from continuing to drink like this, and so much to gain from sobriety. I’ve been drinking heavily for 11 years now, when does it end? I’ve hit rock bottom time and time again, and even though my life appears all shiny and sparkly from the outside, my soul is broken inside. I keep up a good facade though, I’m so this and that. I’m not shit, I’m just another alcoholic struggling to stay sober. I need to be honest with myself about that. It’s time to see myself for what I am: an alcoholic. </p>

<p>I’m done, I’m ready to start this new chapter. I don’t want to drink anymore. I need this. I need to start attending meetings (nightly if necessary) and start working the twelve steps again. Here we go, may God give me strength on this path.</p>"

And one day a miracle happened.. I got busted at work and I was high as fuck..the person who was my senior at work took my into a meeting room and started talking to me asking me why I was high&hellip; My arrogance started talking and soon I was blabbering about the fact that as high as I was my work never suffered.. I was a part of NA AND AA and all the regular bullshit I spew when I get defensive.  He sat and listened and after about ten minutes of me unloading all my crap on him he just said these few sentences..&ldquo; Cut the crap.. You&rsquo;re trying to fool another addict in recovery and I&rsquo;ve 9 years sober..you want to clean up your mess I&rsquo;ll be at this meeting tomorrow and I&rsquo;ll hope to see you..&rdquo; With that he walked away and I was picking up my jaws of the floor.. Back then I wasn&rsquo;t making AA meetings so I didn&rsquo;t know he was in recovery.  Imagine.. I had hit my bottom and my manager from work saw right through it.. I was bottoming out.. That was July 26th 2014.. The next day I went for a meeting.. And the day after and the day after&hellip; And I&rsquo;ve been going ever since.. Completed 18 months a few days ago.. I hope you can make your day everyday just by starting that day with the reality that you are awesome.. Your life is awesome.. The messes won&rsquo;t disappear if you snap a finger.. They will take time.. The trust won&rsquo;t appear outta thin air.. But it is lingering waiting to come back for you.. The using buddies will stay the way they are for life and you have the opportunity to change.. And you will be selfish about your recovery.. Others questions and problems and advice and all of that jazz isn&rsquo;t your problem.. Give me a shout out if you need some talking to.. One day at a time.. That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>"

For personal reasons and because a lot of people I know use tumblr, I’ve decided to stay anonymous. All you need to know is my name and what I live as a recovering addict-alcoholic. </p><p>First of all I MUST confess that I had been sober for three years. Yes, you read that right: HAD. I entered rehab in June 2012, left rehab almost a year after and started my recovery program with Narcotics Anonymous, although I would sometimes go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It’s been a while since I’ve gone to a meeting of either NA or AA ever since I moved to another city to start university. Everything was going well, even without going to the meetings. Even at parties I would be okay with just drinking water, apple juice or lemonade. And if people were smoking weed or taking pills, I’d just stick to my cigarettes. Well, on September 2015 I decided to drink. Because&hellip; why not? It’s already been three years, I’ve been at parties and I’ve been fine without it so why would I not be fine with it again? So I drank one beer. Yes, just one I promise. And I was okay. So a week or two passed and I told two of my best friends what I had done. Almost all my class knows that I was either in rehab or that I don’t drink but now these two knew. I will call them&hellip; C and T. Until today, none of my recovering friends know, nor does my family and neither do my friends from my other city. Only C and T until I decided to drink at a club. And this time I got drunk. Not totally wasted but more then just tipsy. Oh, I forgot to mention that before this, I had drank a few more beers with C and T in the following month, before my drunk night at the club. And after that, on another occasion I decided to drink at a party, and also got pretty drunk. The rest of the days until winter vacation I would drink a beer or two every now and then with C and T&hellip; I can’t stand any other type of drink though, except wine. </p><p>Then winter vacation came in and I didn’t have a single drop of alcohol throughout all December although I must admit, some days I wished I was able to drink. My parents had wine and beer all over the house since family would come and visit, have dinner and celebrate the holidays with us. But I kept it cool and thought actually thought of staring over, pretend I never got drunk and keep counting my days clean and sober. Oh, I haven’t used any other drug though, I have only relapsed with alcohol. And I know this doesn’t make it any better, I just&hellip; need to get this out of my system. I still haven’t been to a meeting and I still haven’t had the courage to go and say this in front of everyone or to even tell any of my other friends and recovering members.</p><p>Then Saturday came along&hellip; January 23, 2016. My parents live two hours away from my city and since I’m still on winter break, I’m at their house. C and T came over visit and we decided to go out. I decided to have one beer. I planned everything out. I would only drink one beer because after an hour it would be out of my system, after that I would only drink water and that way when we went back to my parent’s house I would not be smelling like alcohol and of course, I would be totally sober. And so everything went as planned. I even drove back to the house since C and T where a bit tipsy.</p><p>I know what you are all going to say: FUNCTIONAL ALCOHOLICS DON’T EXIST. But so far, things have actually been okay for me. I still have an inner battle going on though because a big part of me feels guilty afterwards. I’m betraying my parents trust and the trust of many other people who believe in me, who look up to me, who seek me for advise, to have me share my recovery story and all that. That makes me a hypocrite. And then my sick side jumps out on me&hellip; why did I decide to drink again anyway?</p><p>Back to step one&hellip;</p>"

It started with my ex, going over to his house often and stealing a few shots from his mom’s whiskey each time. Then, I realized I liked drinking because it allowed me to let go and not care, which is something I don’t usually do as a socially-anxious introvert. Last semester, I was in a new college living 2500+ miles away from my mom, with basically all the freedom in the world. And at first I was good, I drank every weekend but I was still turning my work in and prepared for my shit. The only problem was that I kept blacking out. No matter what I did, I would black out when I drank. Which was only inconvenient at first, but 

on Halloween, I had to walk two hours home at 2 AM because I drank too much, and then I fucked up at a party earlier this semester and did something while blacked out that I shouldn’t have.</p><p>So after that, I said no more drinking at parties, only in small groups with close friends. Which was fine. I was doing fine. But then I had a rough week, and I decided to get fucked up this weekend. I was fed up with feeling weird and I wanted to let go, as I do when I drink. And boy, did I get royally fucked up. Thankfully, I was with a friend who took good care of me, though she couldn’t stop me from falling and slamming my head into her car.<br/></p><p>I woke up Sunday morning with a blinding headache, a black eye, my piercing ripped out, and the second-worst hangover I’ve ever had. I got out of bed and promptly threw up, and then I slept until four that afternoon. I had a whole load of homework I hadn’t even started due the next day, and all I could do from four that afternoon until 7:30 the next morning was sit in a chair, wrapped in a blanket, and stare at my phone. I didn’t do work or sleep at all Sunday night. It was a never-ending stream in my head, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how much I’d fucked up with drinking this year. Wasted so much money, time, fucked up friendships, made a complete ass out of myself. </p><p>I spent fifteen hours mulling that over in my head, and I came to one decision: I have to start attending AA meetings. I can’t hold myself to a limit and I can’t handle not having a limit. I don’t even like drinking anymore, and I usually feel like shit during and after. I’m falling behind in school and I’m not happy, at all anymore. So I’m going to force myself to get help. I’ve spoken with my teacher about it and he’s going to help me find a meeting place near my apartment.</p><p>It’s weird, though. Seriously fucking weird to think that at nineteen, I’m an alcoholic. Not a severe one by any means, but I am nonetheless; I know, with certainty, that I have a problem with drinking. It used to seem impossible to me, that substance addictions only happened to adults. But I guess I am an adult now, and I make my own decisions, and I face the consequences of those decisions. So once I find a meeting place, it’s off to AA for me, and back on track for my life.</p><p>I’m not really open to questions about this right now, but I do want anyone struggling with this to know they’re not alone. Not in the least. And in some way, it’s nice to know <i>I’m</i> not alone. I’m not the youngest person to be an alcoholic, I’m not the person who’s done the most fucked up things while drunk; my worries are valid but they’re unnecessary. I just have to prove I’m better than that from now on. </p>"

So here&rsquo;s to quitting.. If there&rsquo;s anyone else out there that can help me or give me the support I need it would be much appreciated..</p>"

Of course.  <i>Of course.</i>  </p><p>But I didn’t know that then.  I was doing my best.  Deep down I knew what I wanted, or at least had a sense of it, but I didn’t have the tools nor the courage to engage in the actions that could take me to where I wanted to be.  Where I <i>needed</i> to be.</p><p>As I figured out, as <i>we all figure out</i> when we put down the drink or the drug and decide to <i>get sober, </i>the drinking was but a symptom.  The underlying issues had to be dealt with, no matter how painful or how scary in order to begin to rebuild (and in some cases build for the first time) the sort of life that I envisioned for myself.  One free from fear and superficiality.  In short, I needed a foundation from which to begin, and that foundation began to be laid out for me in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous.  </p><p>Today, almost two and a half years later, the foundation has been firmly laid, the house is built, and the individual rooms are really coming along nicely.  Where once there was a bare and bitter chill, there is a warmth and fullness that continues to expand as I continue to move down this path of sobriety and <i>right living.  </i>Finally my internal and external worlds are congruent and I feel at home, in both mind, spirit, and body.<i> </i>And my-oh-my, it sure is nice.  </p><p>Love &amp; Light,</p><p>CBG</p>"

<br/><br/>Nevertheless, believing I was an alcoholic helped me make sense of the way my mom treated me — and the way I acted in response. If I were an alcoholic, my mother&rsquo;s harsh treatments made sense. My attitude problem (being ungrateful and calling my mother a bitch) was predictive: Only addicts would treat their parents that way. Only alcoholics would end up in a mental hospital, juvenile hall, and now a group home all before they turned 14. Drinking didn&rsquo;t make me an alcoholic. According to the grown-ups who doled out harsh consequences, it was all these harsh consequences that made me an alcoholic.

<p>Good lord, especially in the beginning. All I could do was sit around and think about drinking and doing drugs. It’s gotten easier but I have days where the cravings are so unbearable. </p>

<p>Today is one of them.</p>

<p>I hate being a 27 year old alcoholic and drug addict. The addict in me wishes so badly that I could drink socially. But the sober part of me rationalizes this. </p>

<p>I’ve always struggled with addiction. I knew at 15, alcohol didn’t affect me the same way as it did my friends. It’s always going to affect my differently but sometimes it’s still hard for me to see that.</p>

<p>But I know this:<br/>
1. Alcohol makes me into a person I hate and who others dislike.<br/>
2. I lie, steal, and manipulate when I’m drinking or doing drugs.<br/>
3. Financially, it ruined my life.<br/>
4. My mental health suffered when I was drinking.<br/>
5. My physical health suffered when I was drinking.<br/>
6. I lost friends and family members due to my drug use and alcoholism.<br/>
7. Nothing else mattered to me besides my next drink or drug.<br/>
8. I didn’t experience life to the fullest.<br/>
9. I lost countless jobs because I was too hungover from the night before to go into work.<br/>
10. I lost myself.</p>

<p>The list goes on and on. Those are just a few things that I have to remember when I think about drinking or using.</p>

Tomorrow is a brand new day. Thank God.</p>"

 </p><p>Before S. and I started dating, I was very happy in my life.  I had my own little space in Brooklyn, which was (and still for the most part <i>is</i>) where all of my friends lived.  I went to meetings out there.  I ran all throughout the various neighborhoods.  I biked to meetings in Williamsburg, where there was a whole host of people who were roughly my age, education-level, and whom were similarly-minded.  I went on solo-trips, which I relished.  I bought things with only myself in mind.  I took impromptu weekend hikes with whomever was around and wanted to go.  I went through intense periods of cooking and baking, where I made exactly what I desired, without anyone else in mind.  In short, I had complete and utter freedom, and I fucking loved it.  </p><p>Admittedly, I was actively dating various men and very much wanted to find a partner to share all of this good stuff with, but I was also quite OK and happy without one.  In fact, when S. and I finally got around to meeting in person (which was about 6 months after we had started a dialogue on <i>Tinder,</i> of all places), I was pretty resigned to being single, didn’t anticipate that he and I would actually hit it off, and was <i>happy</i> in that resignation.   But we all know that old adage:  you meet the right person when you least expect it.  We fell hard and fast and deeply in love, and though I think we’ve done quite well at maintaining our individuality, I do think that it’s easy to slip into a bit of codependency when you cohabitate with someone, sharing not only the same physical space, but also building congruent emotional ground, and establishing shared future goals.  </p><p>But perhaps I’m looking at this in too harsh of a light.  It’s certainly not that I feel as though I can’t go on when S. and I are apart, it’s just that I go on doing the things that I do, physically separated from him, but not emotionally so.  Absence of body does not mean absence of heart.  So when I reexamine this situation with open and non-judgmental eyes, I am able to reframe it, realizing that perhaps what I was quick to label “codependency” is actually really just me missing him.  But why should I label my missing him as negative?  Isn’t it nice to miss people sometimes, because then you really appreciate them when you are next together?  And what I realized last evening was that I could simply change how I chose to view today; today does not have to be a day of fear&ndash; worrying about being lonely, or constantly aware of being by myself, but that it could instead be an opportunity to do all of the things that I really love so much:  writing, running, drawing, catching up with friends, etc; all of the stuff that I negotiate my involvement in when S. and I are together.  Because life is all about choices, and anytime you engage in something, you are <i>not</i> engaging in something else, and if you engage in any one thing TOO much, you risk weakening your connection with the other things that you love; you become rather one directional, which in turn places an inevitable heaviness upon the One Thing that you’ve devoted all of your attention to, and over time this can create an imbalance.  </p><p>So.  I am committed to using today as a chance to rebalance a bit; to resume the habits that make me <i>Me</i>, that fill my soul, and nourish my mind and life.  And making this time and space to write what’s at the depth of my being&ndash; my current truth&ndash; is a major piece of that, because like Joan Didion has, and often writes, it is through this process that I am able to figure out what I really think and feel.  And often times, what initially seems like a scary obsessional messy rotation of thoughts in my brain, ends up presenting itself upon the page as a neat, kind, holistic summary of how I truly feel. </p><p>Alone does not equal lonely.</p><p>Love &amp; Light,</p><p>CBG   </p>"

<p>For 12 years this program was very much a part of my life. Before you start making up stuff. I am NOT an alcoholic. But apparently I love me some alcoholics. It’s true. I’m a magnet to them</p>

I have theories. But the truth is, I don&rsquo;t know how it happens. I gravitate to them. I started going to Al-Anon during my first marriage, for family and friends of alcoholics. I was married to an active alcoholic who was very deep in denial. Then I married an alcoholic who was in recovery, ten years sober. We worked both sides of AA. And we were the poster couple for this anonymous group. I questioned a lot. But I knew it had worked for so many. But still. There was something I didn&rsquo;t buy. I spoke, we spoke, we told our separate and collective stories. I gave him his chips at his anniversary meetings. We did it together. Him on his side, me on mine. 

When I found out about the affair I felt like there was a room of people, his &ldquo;friends&rdquo;, who knew what he was doing but because what is said in the room stays in the room&hellip; They never said a word to me. These people, did they ever tell him once he was wrong? Did they ever tell him he was being dishonest and immoral? Did they ever tell him marriage gets hard sometimes? Was a single person in that room on my side? It didn&rsquo;t feel like that. When I asked him what the room said,&ldquo;whatever makes me happy&rdquo;.

And that was it&hellip;fuck them
And fuck that program. 

I was angry. Everything I heard, everything I read came from the stupid &ldquo;book&rdquo;. If I heard &ldquo;take it one day at a time&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. A knee jerk reaction that had been programmed on both sides. I wanted real words, real emotions. Still today if I hear that, I hate it. 

Alcoholism is a selfish, self centered disease. Active or recovered, he was selfish. &ldquo;Whatever makes me happy&rdquo;

Did this seem to come from out of nowhere? There&rsquo;s a reason. In my dating escapades, the very top of the list for a future relationship is they can not be an addict-active or recovered. Just say NO. so I&rsquo;m chatting with this guy. And we discuss this list on the phone (rare to hear a voice these days). And the list has become a joke. So he asks, what am I looking for? So in hopes to make him laugh I start. 

1. Can not be an addict- active or recovered
2. Can not drive a white beetle

I hear laughter. And I say&hellip; Please don&rsquo;t say you drive a beetle. Just DON&rsquo;T. 

He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sober&rdquo;

Of course he is. Of course. And then all that had been buried came to the surface. I&rsquo;m still talking to him. I haven&rsquo;t met him. He&rsquo;s ten years sober. Works the program. 

Why?"

If we are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure to drink.","Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous  p. 70"

<p>“I LOVE when you come to this meeting. I love listening to smart people.”</p>

<p>And then after the meeting, a man told me to not leave until he had a chance to talk to me. So I stuck around and he said:</p>

<p>“I want to tell you this every time you’ve come but I haven’t had the chance. Hang on to your shining enthusiasm, because it makes up so much of who you are. You’re 22 and bright and optimistic about something like being sober, and that is a rare, God-given gift. By the looks of you, and the fact that you’re smart as a whip, God has truly blessed you. Never forget that - you really can’t ask for much more. I am so proud of you.”</p>

<p>Wow. </p>

<p>It’s a beautiful day.</p>"

<p>But this time I want it to be different. I want to hold my head up high when I walk into those rooms tomorrow evening for the first time in a few weeks. Because if I don’t feel comfortable with being in a meeting then what the hell am I doing?</p>

<p>AA is a place where you can go after a shitty day and someone beside you gets it. Like really understands where you’ve been and your struggles. Us alcoholics are lucky. Anyone, in fact, who goes to a support group is lucky. It’s hard to find that elsewhere. </p>

<p>So I’m going to go tomorrow. If you are struggling to get to a meeting, just fucking do it. There are no excuses so stop telling yourself there are.</p>"

It’s where you go to learn how to LIVE sober.” and “the problem isn’t stopping, it’s STAYING stopped.” and there were stories of people who’d stopped for a few months before hopping off the wagon again.</p><p>i haven’t even made it past 5 days. im almost to 3 days and usually i fail about this time, the last two weeks of attending AA, but today I didn’t. today, at least, im still sober.</p><p>“Keep coming back, it works if you work it.”<br/></p><p>I think I like this “beginners” meeting a lot more than the one with all the seniors. These guys admit they were still drinking at the beginning, and some of them have years and years of sobriety but most are in their first year. I feel less judged there, especially after that lady from last week or whenever at the other place. I’m not sure I’ll ever go back to that one tbh. I had loved it there.</p><p>I texted my sponsor if she thinks I should be looking for another job. I admitted I’m not getting many hours at the theater, but I have just changed my availability (after being officially fired last week from my second job). I said my dad is pestering me about it, but part of the reason I was drinking so much, at least on the surface, was the stress from working full-time through two jobs and going to college full-time, and that next semester I’m taking even more credits.</p><p>Not so much on the surface, I know the real reason is I’m still a very emotionally immature person. I can’t handle stress and the acts of daily living. I’m self-critical, depressed, and anxious. That was also touched on the meeting today. It’s the basis of all addictions, really, I think. We just can’t handle life for some reason.</p>"

focus on me and my own self care.</p><p>When I first started this new job five months ago, I was warned against making it my recovery.  I didn’t know what that meant at the time, but now I do.  When I work with other addicts and alcoholics all day, supporting them in their own recovery and rallying them to go to meetings and engage in self-care, the last thing I want to do after work is go to a meeting.  Boxing-yes- I love beating the bejesus out of a heavy bag after a stressful work day, but sitting through an AA meeting at the end of my day just sounds so unappealing, and thus, I must admit it:  I’ve become complacent in my own recovery.  But I want to rectify that; I want to get back to some of my best habits:  meeting-making, sponsorship, and writing more.  And so, I begin, albeit with a healthy dose of wariness given the data surrounding the lasting-power of New Years’ resolutions.  But, one day at a time, right?</p><p>I went to a great meeting this afternoon; my second this week, which doesn’t sound like much, but is an improvement from the past few months where I found myself going to one meeting a week, <i>maybe</i>.  The positive impact meeting attendance has on my well-being is self-evident, and I’ve learned this over-and-over-and-over again.  I know that recovery is a lifelong process- it’s a practice- and I need and want to get back into shape.  </p><p>When I don’t regularly engage in the things that fill my heart and my soul (meetings, writing, running/boxing, drawing), I lean into self-destruction, and I have a plethora of ways in which I can outsource this life-long tendency: smoking, eating too much sugar, rumination, obsession- self-care negligence in general.  And I have fallen into some of those negative habits again.  The main one right now is smoking, and I feel guilty about it.  I am a fitness fanatic, and fitness model, after all and this split-life is ridiculous.  And at the same time, I understand why I’ve slipped back into it; my job is incredibly stressful, my boyfriend smokes, and, as mentioned, I’ve let my self-care slip a bit.  The habit makes me feel horrible physically, and yet I do it.  The parallels to my drinking past are clear.  Insanity, for sure.  </p><p>So, I want to quit, again, in theory.  I say “in theory” because I’ve already smoked today and will continue to do so.  I need to reread the book that has helped me quit smoking every time I’ve quit smoking (how’s that for paradox?), “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking,” and make a pros/cons list about it, and continue to exercise (because being reminded of the drop in my cardiac ability is a huge motivator for me), and continue going to meetings.  All of these things help, and so, I will do it&hellip;again.  It’s been an off-again-on-again process since May, when I relapsed on cigarettes in Paris.  And I can’t lie, I LOVED smoking in Paris, and I’m very aware of the romanticism I’ve attached to the situation, but the truth is, I did love lounging at the cafes, drinking espresso by the carafe, and smoking Parisian cigarettes (which somehow seem much kinder to my lungs than their American counterpart).  But let me be frank, smoking lesser quality cigarettes in New Jersey in the winter is in NO way romantic, and makes me feel unhealthy and weak; two of my least favorite ways to feel.  And thus, smoking must cease.  Very soon.</p><p>2015 was a really huge year.  My relationship flourished and we moved in together.  We also got a kitten.  I got a new job that in some ways, I was underqualified for, and have thus learned more than I could have imagined.  It challenges me both personally and professionally, and is most definitely outside of my comfort zone.  I fantasize at least 173 times a week about quitting it, but I want to learn more, grow more, and leave on good terms and with a solid recommendation in place, and so I stay.  My relationship with my parents improved.  My grandfather, who was the true patriarch of our family, died, bringing many tears, happy memories, and a sort of family restructuring.  I made some new friends, and parted ways with some others.  I ran my fourth half marathon.  I booked some really major-league fitness modeling jobs (most of which should be coming out in the media circuit very soon).  I parted ways with my first sponsor.  I’ve grown comfortable around children, namely my boyfriend’s daughter, and my (soon-to-be) sister-in-law’s son.  I subleased a car.  My credit score improved.  I experienced living on my own for the first time, and realized that I don’t love it as much as I’d thought I would.  I went to London, Paris, Prague, the Jersey Shore, and Florida (twice).  I worked as the lead researcher on a dissertation which earned a grant.  I learned how to pronounce many words in (Jersey) Italian, and perhaps in some ways related: I learned how to apply fake eyelashes.  Really well.</p><p>Big. Year. Bigger than my first year in sobriety (which was huge), and my second (which was even bigger).  I got sober when I was 29.  I’ll be 32 on Monday.  That span is incredible and unbelievable to me.  I have almost two and a half years sober, and I started this blog on day 3 (I think).  </p><p>Things aren’t perfect.  New growth brings new challenges, and this pattern will continue throughout the rest of my lifespan.  But, I am <i>living</i> this life.  I’m here for it everyday.  I no longer hide behind the haze of alcohol; procrastinating from the bottom of a vodka bottle in a feeble attempt to put off the fears associated with life.  I have tolerated immense pain in sobriety without picking up a drink, because I know to the depths of my core that alcohol will never fix or even adequately bandage <i>any</i> feelings I have.  The only way out is through.  </p><p>Today’s meeting was a Big Book meeting and we read the story, “Grounded”.  My favorite line and something I’ve been thinking about lately:  “I remembered that courage is not the absence of fear; it was the ability to continue in the face of it.”  More new chapters are about to begin in my life- big ones- and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have fear.  But I’ve learned enough by now to know that I just have to keep going.  One foot in front of the other.  Day by day, and allow whatever will be, to be.  </p><p>So maybe this isn’t about starting new things, maybe it’s more about recommitting to the old ones that I know work.  And as far as I’m concerned, there is NO stigma in that.</p><p>Happy and healthy New Year,</p><p>CBG</p>"

I am so grateful to be in recovery. I&rsquo;m looking at apartments and was nominated for some type of award at work. I have Chrissy and Liam in my life and was able to see them yesterday for 5 minutes and give them their presents.</p>

<p>This week Step 3(turning my will and care to God as I understand him) has been reappearing in meetings and have my theme. I have realized that I had tried to be the director; to control my life and make it the way I wanted it. But depression and resentments were taking over my life, and it led to my recent relapse. It was one of my factors as to why drinking and abusing meds seemed so much better than recovery. But I am done trying to be in control; I am letting my higher power do the work, and is giving me good things, whether I need them or they are just surprises.</p>

<p>Another thing that might be playing a factor in struggling with step 3, is my childhood sexual abuse. I was never in control and trapped within this nightmare I had endured. I couldn&rsquo;t fix the fact that was happening; ever since high school, I was searching for control. Controlling my friends and their actions. Controlling teachers and parents in how they should treat me nicely; sometimes I manipulated this and use this to my advantage so I can get what I wanted. This wasn&rsquo;t good either. Control usually plays a part in my eating disorder as well.</p>

<p>So while I work I need to be the one to work on myself and my recovery, I need the guide of my higher power to help me. I cannot do the work on my own. My higher power knows what I need and will provide me things in the moment. God will help me stay sober and work on myself on a daily basis. I need to trust that my higher power is looking out for me. </p>

<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m going with flow. It&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>"

An hour into being there, Tyler arrives and I start to ask what he’s working today, and he says, “no, wait. Before we talk- how are you doing?” And I’m like, “im….I’m ok, thank you.” And he says, “I was so surprised.” And I said, “yeah, everyone was haha.” And another coworker nearby says, “what?” And Tyler looks at me and is like, “uh, well she can tell you if she wants.” And I’m like, “it was on facebook! You liked my status!” And he goes, “i like a lot of things!” And Tyler goes, “she’s an alcoholic.” And the other coworker goes, “oh yeah, I meant to ask you.” And then tyler tells me to hang in there, that he’s surprised he’s not addicted to anything because his dad was a meth head and his uncle or someone an alcoholic. And im like, “well, my hands are shaking pretty bad right now. But I’m at four days by the end of this shift!” And Tyler says, “wow! Four days, that’s great! And hey, the worst thing you can do is go cold turkey.” But I don’t really have the option to not right now.</p><p>  <br/>Then later another coworker comes and asks how I am, to which I reply “alright, thanks!” And he does a dramatic fist pump, “well…hang in there!”<br/>
The rest of the night the coworker who tyler told would ask me on random intervals how I was doing. I definitely felt loved.</p><p><br/>
My chest did hurt pretty bad today but I’m feeling pretty ok right now.<br/>
Star wars was not that bad. It helps it was a Friday morning though. I’m worried about tomorrow night.</p><p><br/>
We had a team huddle before we opened and the manager was like, “is everyone good? Is everyone good? I want you to be on your A game today so if you’re not 100% tell me and I’m sending you home!” I thought about mentioning I’m detoxing but I didnt. I just delt with trembling hands and aching chest the next 7 hours, except the last hour where I was goofy again. </p><p>I also finally got those two PCs for calling out sick and missing the meeting. I thought of telling the manager then what was going on but chickened out. if I miss something again, I’m on suspension. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Then I waited a while to take a bus to the AA meeting I’d planned out last night. Took an earlier bus because I’d rather wait there then at a bus stop. It was on the corner near where I used to live and is pretty scary-looking at night. People hanging about who looked like tweakers from savers, or some who looked like people I used to party with. Loud and “ghetto” and I was a little scared until I heard them talking about sobriety and the power of prayer and one guy talked to me a good 20 minutes about the purpose and importance of the Steps and in getting a sponsor. People had there kids there too and hearing some of these people talk I’m so glad I got out of drugs when I did (also, turns out it was also CA meeting, not AA) and I almost left but hey I used to do cocaine and it’s all the same thing and I still found it helpful. I felt bad for judging them&ndash;I’m no different than they are just because I’ve never been to jail or had kids taken away from me. I’m no different just because I got out sooner. And I really didn’t get out sooner- I just swapped.</p><p>And that was one thing I briefly shared on. We took tickets that I had no idea what it was for, until they started calling numbers, and then we were to pick a number from 1-44 and reflect on that topic. Mine was one of the 20 or so called and I was so so anxious. “Hi&hellip;.uh, I’m Ashley&hellip;.” “ASHLEY!” They called back. I picked number 7 I think, and it was on participation. I said, “Well, haha, I’m participating right now! (people laugh) Um,” and some lady is smiling at me in a kind way, “Share whatever you want to,” she said. “Uh,” say, “Well, I thought this was an AA meeting. But I mean, I used to do cocaine. I guess my problem is I just keep switching&hellip;..and, well&hellip;” “What lead you here?” The lady prompts. “Well,” I say, “I showed up to work wasted on Monday at 3pm and got fired yesterday and I guess things just aren’t that great right now&hellip;.But I’m 4 days sober from alcohol, which is longer than I’ve gone in a long time&hellip;.Pass.” People clapped and said “Thanks, Ashley!”</p><p>Honestly, the people at these meetings are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, just trying to help themselves and help others get through their shit and life. We’ve all done bad things but we’re still people and there’s still good in us.</p>

<p>Then on the way home I took the bus 4 miles too far north and dad, pissed off, came and picked me up at 10pm. He just didn’t get that there’s not always a bus going to a stop you need at the time you need it.</p><p>In some ways I’m already feeling better. The detox/withdraw symptoms are lessening, and although getting smashed is still the first thing I think of when something bad or upsetting or frustrating or stressful happens, I can pause and think about it a little more. I swear, as dumb as it sounds, my little “desire” chip has helped so much. I rub it between my fingers when I’m anxious or have a “burning desire” and it helps a little. I guess until I’m closer to God or have a spiritual awakening or whatever, my first little 24-hour chip that I got not even at 24 hours is my higher power right now. Sorry, God. Working on it.</p>"

Because of busses, I was there half an hour early (passed at least 5 bars/saloons and several gas stations on the way). I talked to the guy who runs the meeting and he was like “aww you’re cute. I like talking to you!” (but not in a creepy way, he’s 50 and might be gay, not entirely sure). he has been sober 18 months and was really proud when i helped asked if he wanted help setting up. “wow, you’re giving back already! that’s what this is all about!” I shared a bit with him about how I ended up there, and he thinks I’m doing great for 3 days in after how much I was drinking. This meeting was a “confession” meeting this time and we all went around and shared. I confessed yesterday was really tough for me but I reached out, which is something I used to never do, and got through it. And now I’m at 3 days and some hours (then i was a few hours shy) and everyone was super proud and amazed and it felt great.

"http://skulliens.tumblr.com/post/135407606907/drugs-and-abuse-tw-12-step-programs-do-more-harm","2015-12-17 23:14:40 GMT","[u'shut up sly no one cares', u'alcoholics anonymous', u'12 step']","text","drugs and abuse tw: 12 step programs do more harm than good","<p>As someone who used to abuse drugs (mainly benzos and opiates but I’d take whatever I could get my hands on), got clean for two years, and now moderately uses alcohol and weed: 12 step drug programs are not a good solution for addiction.</p>

<p>I definitely needed the support of other people who weren’t using when I first got clean.  It was nice to be able to go and vent about my problems and listen to other people talk about theirs.  I got hope from people who shared their success stories, and as I got more clean time newer people started to look to me for support.  I made friends there.  Don’t get me wrong, support groups are a good thing.</p>

<p>However I think there’s something very cultish about telling people they have an incurable disease (addiction) and their only hope for survival is to dedicate their lives to a program, try to get all their friends who use drugs into the program, cut off anyone who isn’t in the program, etc.  The steps themselves tell you that you must repent for every bad thing you’ve done and ask God to guide you from here on out.  If you’re not religious this can be a big hurdle, and many people I knew in the rooms believed you couldn’t truly recover unless you accepted God.  A lot of people in the program defend it by saying “your higher power can be anything.”  It can be “the universe” (which is just another BS way of saying God; the universe isn’t looking out for you, it’s a place, not a sentient thing), it can be the meetings and the people there who support you, it can be whatever the hell you want, even a doorknob. (no really, it actually says that in one of the books)  They try to act like it’s not a religious program when every damn meeting starts off with a prayer.</p>

<p>Whether you believe in God or not, pushing all your problems off onto God and expecting Him to solve them for you is the exact opposite of taking responsibility for your life.  When I was snorting klonopin in my dad’s basement instead of getting a job, I was pushing all responsibility away.  When I got clean I was making a decision to be a responsible person.  “Turning it over to God” only encourages you to stay helpless.  The whole program encourages learned helplessness.  You are hopelessly broken and sick, you cannot possibly be trusted to solve your own problems, and you <i>better be fucking sorry about it.  However, </i>every bad thing that has ever happened to you is still your fault.  While doing my “moral inventory” (that’s what they call it when you answer 100+ questions about all the bad things you’ve done) I wrote about being traumatized by my family&rsquo;s dysfunction.  The sponsor I had told me I didn’t address what part I had in it.  Yeah, I was being told I had to be responsible for the fact that I was born to two people that hated each other, because only the bad things that happen to you are your fault.  The good things?  You had no part in that, that’s God.</p>

<p>After being clean for over a year going to meetings started to make me feel worse instead of better.  Here I was, letting some dumb things I did as a teenager define me forever (”once an addict, always an addict”) instead of growing.  I couldn’t progress in my stepwork because turning my will over to a fucking doorknob instead of taking responsibility for my own actions was some of the stupidest crap I’d ever heard.  The program values honesty, and I realized that by acting like it was still helping me I was being massively dishonest.  Know what actually gave me peace with my history of addiction?  Moving on with my fucking life, instead of going to meetings 2-3 times a week to talk about how much it sucks to be an addict.</p>

<p>If AA, NA, etc could just admit they’re support groups with a religious slant, (albeit very ineffective, victim blaming ones) that would be fine.  But this stuff is touted as being scientific.  If someone is arrested on drug charges, they’re usually court ordered to go to a 12 step program.  <b>We need a better solution.  </b>The success rate for 12 step programs is something like 5 percent.  People in the program defend this statistic by saying that anyone who can’t stick with it is “constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.”  Again, victim blaming, self flagellation is the only cure for your addiction.  Suppose there was a treatment that for 5% of people who took it, cured their cancer.  The remaining 95% either had no change or their cancer got worse.  Are they “constitutionally incapable” of accepting the treatment, or is it just a bad treatment?</p>"

How often can I say that I feel worse coming out of the meeting than I did going in? Not often. Just had a lot of things well beyond my control happen, and I&rsquo;m still learning to accept the things I cannot change. I&rsquo;m a firstborn child and a Scorpio - summed up, I&rsquo;m a control freak. When that eight inches of shit between my ears gets going in a rage, it&rsquo;s hard to stop the pain train for my mental wellbeing from coming. But that&rsquo;s part of the reason I started blogging about my recovery. I&rsquo;m a writer. Writing is almost like therapy to me.<br/>
The first thing that is really getting to me is what my grandmother said last week. Accusing me of wanting to steal my mentally retarded brother&rsquo;s behavior meds to get a high. Next week, I&rsquo;ll have to sit down with that side of the family for Christmas Eve dinner and pretend like the accusations never happened and that I&rsquo;m happy to be there. I so desperately wanted to close on Christmas Eve at work so I could avoid that entire side of the family. My boss, however, has other plans for me that day. Ones that would have me opening with her so I can learn the procedures. I would rather be anywhere else on the planet than sit and be forced to make nice with people who judge me for who I was. Not be proud of who I am now and what I&rsquo;m striving to be. The holiday season is a tricky time to be a recovering alcoholic. I would rather just stay at home and read, play video games, or watch a movie than sit and bear the brunt of the judgmental gazes and whispers behind my back. I guess I&rsquo;m lucky in the fact that even the idea of picking up another drink makes me feel sick to my stomach, so temptation isn&rsquo;t even a factor for me.<br/>
Issue number two, unsurprisingly enough, is work. I was recently promoted, so my boss now feels like she can openly share her feelings about coworkers and the vendors who come into the store with me. This is where it gets kind of tricky and is probably breaking a boatload of rules, but I&rsquo;m currently in a relationship with one of our sales reps. A sales rep my boss just loves to rag on in secret. Now, I&rsquo;m no saint. I do talk smack about my coworkers, but only to friends who don&rsquo;t even live in the same area I do and I use nicknames. She did it last week, and she did it again today. This time around, I could actually hear her instead of the rattle of the garbage cart as I took trash out to the dumpster. She called him &ldquo;weird&rdquo; and said that he was &ldquo;bad at his job&rdquo;. I know for sure that I&rsquo;m biased, since we are dating, but you don&rsquo;t talk shit about people behind their backs, especially if you don&rsquo;t know the person! I see him as an intelligent, talented, goofy, and handsome man. I&rsquo;m also protective and loyal, almost to a fault. It took every ounce of willpower not to tear into her, as I once did to people making fun of my brother. I know I can&rsquo;t control her feelings, but I&rsquo;m in complete control of mine. Perhaps diplomatically approaching her and politely requesting not to hear things like that about others is a good idea? That way I can keep myself out of situations that put me in a bad headspace that make me more liable to pick up a bottle again, despite how I dry heave at the very thought of it. This promotion comes with enough stress. I don&rsquo;t need the anger adding fuel to a very volatile fire.</p>"

This time last year, I was a totally different person. I wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize myself!<br/>
That isn&rsquo;t to say the trip hasn&rsquo;t been without its struggles. Temptation has been there. I&rsquo;ve learned to use the tools I was given by the program to maintain sobriety. People don&rsquo;t understand what my issues are, don&rsquo;t get the program, accuse me of wanting to steal my mentally retarded brother&rsquo;s meds to take for myself (yes, really), but I&rsquo;ve stayed strong.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve watched friends and AA group members fall off the wagon, come back on the wagon, and even lose their battles. I use their experiences as learning, only fueling my drive to stay sober. Losing a young group member and friend only strengthened my resolve to maintain my sobriety.<br/>
I wasted a decade being constantly wasted. I entered the last year of my 20s sober, happy, healthy, but not without regrets that I wasted an entire decade because I couldn&rsquo;t cope. I don&rsquo;t wish what I went through on anyone, but my story has given hope to others in need of it. I was abused, raped, told it was all my fault for letting someone so close to me do what he did. I watched my grandmother die a slow, agonizing death to pancreatic cancer. I learned that someone who was a horrific bully to me all through my public school days had murdered a baby by shaking him because he wouldn&rsquo;t stop crying. Guilt is a heavy burden to bear. Nightmares haunted me constantly at night, causing me to wake up crying and completely paralyzed in fear. To drink meant I didn&rsquo;t have to feel, meant the nightmares stopped. I essentially stopped living, hit the pause button on my life, and I honestly didn&rsquo;t care if I woke up the next morning or not. I inevitably did when the fifth I drank the night before came back to haunt me in the form of hangovers that lasted for days. I always swore never again, but I inevitably broke that promise time and again.<br/>
It wasn&rsquo;t until I got so drunk that I was freaking out, crying, and calling suicide hotlines that my family decided to act. They held an intervention. I was told to get to an AA meeting or I&rsquo;d lose my keys and be institutionalized. I went. My first meeting, I was an emotional wreck. I might have actually gone through the five stages of grieving in the span of that hour. I was in familiar-yet-not territory, a church in town where I&rsquo;d stop for a cigarette in the parking lot from time to time after work. I followed a crowd down to the basement, only to accidentally wind up in an AlAnon meeting first. I eventually found my way, crept in out of fear that I&rsquo;d be noticed, and sat down at a table. To my utter mortification, I wound up sitting next to someone I knew as a customer at work - an older man, tough as nails - in that moment, he took my hand and squeezed it, silently reassuring me it would be okay. I was in the right place and was safe. That was the day my life changed for the better.<br/>
I have no regrets about sobering up. So much good has come from it. I was promoted at work, I found a new relationship with someone who knows my demons and supports my decision to not drink when we go out. Life is cleaner, brighter, happier. I just hope that I can stay on the right path.<br/>

<p>We come from a variety of personal and professional backgrounds. Some of us, probably very few, approach speaking in a meeting like breathing—we know what we want to say, we form our thoughts and we present them in a logical flow. There is no nervousness, no anxiety.</p>

<p>Then there’s the rest of us.  We angst over what we want to say, we’re nervous, we babble and um our way through a share, desperately trying to find a wrap up, missing it, circling back, finally just finding a close. It is not an easy effort.  </p>

<p>Worth considering next time you think someone is prattling on too long in a meeting is the idea that they know they are going on too long too. They are struggling, and, like you, wish they could find the end. A nod or a smile can be a wonderful life preserver.</p>"

He mostly smoked pot and was an alcoholic but there may have been more going on that we didn’t know about but the bottom line was that he almost didn’t graduate high school (and wouldn’t have if he wasn’t incredibly talented and charming to begin with) and there was even a time during his senior year of high school when he and his friends snuck out of their houses to skip school on Friday and drive down to Florida for a music festival. My older brother was in the passenger seat with his seatbelt on. His best friend was lying across the back seat, no seat belt. The driver fell asleep. His best friend died in the crash that night. It was really rough on everyone involved and their families. My older brother’s problems got worse&ndash; he started stealing my Adderall, emptying the capsules and replacing them with sugar so he could sell the powder for more drug money (and possibly snorting the powder himself for a quick high; still not sure on the details there). My parents kicked him out of the house. Things got worse (of course). Then he spent some time living with my grandmother in baton rouge. She was an enabler. But that’s around the time that he decided he was going to get better. He came home and was miserably sick for two solid weeks while he detoxed. My parents took care of him.

They founded Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935 on the concept of mutual aid, in which members go through a twelve-step system to recovery. AA has now become an international organization, which seeks to spread this message of sharing and reconciliation to bring people together in the healing process.</p><p>AA has been joined by a handful of institutions in their approach to treating addiction, including the Betty Ford Center founded in 1982. Pictured here is a letter from Johnny Cash to Betty Ford, thanking her for the treatment that he received at the Center. An addict herself, Betty famously took the step of going public about her struggle with substance abuse, quickly becoming an example of success through treatment, as seen in this public service announcement poster.</p><p>You can discover these documents and much more in the current exhibit, “Spirited Republic,” which explores America’s long and often mixed relationship with alcohol through original archival documents.

was Christmas Eve, 1965—my parent’s first Christmas together as newlyweds.
Mom’s brother Pete and his wife, Lucy, purchased a new home in Oak Lawn,
Illinois, a southwestern suburb of Chicago. Their home was beautifully
decorated for the holiday, and was immaculate—not a thing was out of place. They
invited the entire Sheedy clan over to celebrate including all nine of their
nieces and nephews, who were under the age of twelve. Mom’s sister Lois invited
her boyfriend, Bob, aka the Polish Cowboy, to meet the family for the first
time. </p><p>At
the height of the party, the children ran amok through the house. During their
mayhem, they accidentally broke Pete and Lucy’s new laundry chute. Exactly how
the laundry chute broke and who was responsible, remains a mystery to this day.
The men, including Grandpa Sheedy, congregated in the basement and were happily
getting drunk. Nana Sheedy and the other women sought refuge from all the
commotion in the kitchen. My parents were both drunk and having one of their
world-renowned screaming matches in the recreation room. Mom wanted to stay at
the party with her family, and Dad wanted to leave. <i>Ah, the joy of the
holidays.</i> Dad demanded Mom get her coat and shoes on, and, as he exited the
room, shouted, “I’ll pick you up in the alley.”</p><p>What
Dad failed to realize during his drunken tirade was they were in the suburbs,
and there were no alleys. Stubborn as he was, however, Dad did not let that
stop him. He got into his car, revved his engine loudly, and gunned it. He
created his own alley by tearing down whatever obstacles stood in his way—including
fences, manicured lawns, and sod. The pristine white snow turned to mud as his
spinning wheels flung dirt clods of grass high up into the air. </p><p>Dad’s
car came to a grinding halt as it got stuck in the mud behind the neighbor’s
house. My parent’s private fight suddenly became very public as Dad kicked
opened the car door, stumbled out, and exchanged a plethora of un-pleasantries with
the neighbors. Right in the middle of Dad’s rant, his foot got sucked into the
mud like quicksand and knocked him off his feet. </p><p>Realizing
he was unable to extricate his car out of the mud alone, Dad got up and marched
toward Pete and Lucy’s house for help. Unfortunately, all the cookie cutter houses
in their neighborhood looked exactly the same. The only way Dad could tell them
apart was by the address. Covered in mud from head to toe, he stomped up Pete
and Lucy’s front steps, flung open the door, and traipsed across the brand-new
living room carpet leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind him.</p><p>“My
car is stuck in the alley. Can someone help me push it out?” Dad asked then meandered
back to his car. </p><p>Stunned
party goers, in awe over the spectacle they witnessed, asked in unison, “What
alley?”</p><p>Everyone
at the party went running to the back window to see what happened. Lois’s
boyfriend, Bob, tried to distract the children by doing magic tricks and
telling jokes. Mom, sensing Dad was about to explode, was determined to go
outside and defuse him. She fought her way through the crowd and headed toward
the back door. Her sister Peggy stopped her before she went outside.</p><p>“You
can’t go out there like that, Pat. It’s winter. You’ll catch a death of cold.
Here, wear my shoes.” Peggy took off her flats and offered them to Mom. As Mom
fumbled to put on her sister’s shoes, the argument outside came to a boil.</p><p>Uncle
John is one of the few people who can reason with Dad when he is drunk. He and
Dad are very close. They have known each other ever since they were kids and
played baseball together. Curious to find out what Dad was ranting about, John
followed him outside. “Are you crazy, Ronnie?” John screamed as he witnessed firsthand
the carnage that was once the neighbor’s backyard. </p><p>Dad
turned to confront John and fell face first into the mud.</p><p>Much
to Dad’s chagrin, the police arrived on the scene right on cue. Peggy sent her
husband, Frank, out to stop Dad before he did something he regretted. Mom
attempted to slip out the back door with Frank, but her family urged her to
stay inside and let the police handle matters. </p><p>As
Dad tells it, “There I was, crawling through the mud, when I happened upon a
pair of well-polished, patent leather shoes. I looked up and saw an angry Oak
Lawn police officer glaring down at me.”</p><p>Dad
crawled between the police officer’s legs and made a break for it. The officer
turned around, grabbed Dad by the scruff of the neck, and pulled him back up to
his feet. Dad steadied his footing and took a rounding swing at the officer.
Not the soundest judgment, for it landed him and Frank in a heap of trouble. </p><p>“Ronnie,
don’t!” Frank pleaded, as he stepped in between Dad and the police officer. </p><p>Dad
missed the police officer and hit Frank instead, right in the kisser then
swirled to the ground. John pleaded with the officer to let his brothers-in-laws
go, but he soon realized it was futile. Dad and Frank were arrested, charged
with disturbing the peace, and spent the night in jail. </p><p>My
parents had no money for bail. Luckily, Pete and Lucy came to the rescue and
bailed Dad out of jail the next morning, so he could spend the rest of the
holiday with his blushing, hung-over bride.</p><p>Two
weeks later, Dad and Frank were scheduled to appear in court. Still bruised
from the experience, Frank explained to the judge he was merely trying to
prevent his brother-in-law from hitting the police officer. The police officer
corroborated his story. The judge dismissed the charges against Frank and let
him go. Dad, however, never showed up for court. The charges against him were
dropped, and he got off scot-free.</p>"

My mom pulled up just as I was leaving, and I waited to tell her where I was going. She leaned down, grabbed my head, and tried to kiss me. She reeked of alcohol. </p><p>When I came back later that night, she was passed out on the couch. I tried to wake her up. She groaned and rolled into the blanket. I kept shaking her, asking her to wake up. She started saying numbers. “10, 20, 700, 800. No!” I asked her what she was saying. She repeated the numbers and swatted at me. I pulled the blanket off of her and told her to go to bed. She asked why everything was so bright, and I told her it was the lights on the Christmas tree. She started telling me that we shouldn’t have a Christmas tree, because we’re supposed to be in Mexico until tomorrow (no idea). I made her get up and go upstairs, and she started yelling at me about how she’s so mad because we weren’t supposed to leave Mexico yet. She walked around going on and on about it, yelling at me and telling me I don’t understand, so I finally called her out on being drunk. She said she hadn’t had anything to drink, and when I said I could smell it on her breath, she started yelling at me about Mexico again. </p><p>I closed the door to my room, frustrated. Frustrated and angry and annoyed and heartbroken. </p><p>We had just spent five days in Puerto Rico together; she was sober for the first three. It was so wonderful, to have a mother I could talk to and have fun with. I wasn’t ashamed to be in public with her. She was nice to me, and she made sense. I saw a mother I never thought I had, honestly. When she got drunk on the fourth night I realized that this mom – the sloppy, volatile, loud, argumentative mom – was actually drunk mom. I realized, suddenly, that I had thought drunk mom was just Mom for my whole life. At age twenty, I was seeing my real mom for the first time. </p><p>And that made me so, so angry. I have never gotten to know my mother. That’s heartbreaking. I felt orphaned. I felt cheated. I was (and am) so so sad at not knowing my mother. </p><p>And to come home last night and see her wasted like that… </p><p>Anyway this morning I got a little crazy. I looked in her hiding place where she keeps her alcohol, and I found a 1.5 liter bottle of wine, three quarters empty. I then dug through the garbage and found the receipt from the store last night. She had bought that bottle of wine at 5:56 pm, just minutes before I saw her as I was getting ready to leave. When I came home at 8:45, she was passed out drunk. On a Wednesday. </p><p>I know my garbage-hunting was kind of crazy behavior, but how else are you supposed to deal with a crazy person? How can I stay calm and sane when I come home to two alcoholics every night? How am I supposed to do finals next week when my study space is constantly being invaded my two stumbling, harassing assholes? </p><p>I’m glad I get to stay at my aunt’s this weekend. Her dog, Pippa, has been cuddling and comforting me. And I get to see D. tomorrow, which should make all of this so much better. He always cheers me up and calms me down. </p><p>I don’t really want to tell him about the garbage-digging thing though. I feel like he’ll get mad or weirded out. Actually that’s not true. I know he would just say that I shouldn’t do that, because it’s unhealthy for me, but I don’t want to hear that. I should really be honest though. If I can’t admit to the person I love the kinds of things that I do, who can I admit them to? Any y’know, admitting your problems is the first step to fixing them. I really, really want to fix them. I want to be normal. I want to be happy. Someday I want to have a functional loving family, with children who feel safe in their home. </p><p>In my wildest dreams, my kids would even get to know their grandparents. But right now, if my parents won’t change, there’s no way that can happen. </p>"

I am grateful that my true friends are supportive of me and care about me; that one I had trouble with, but I am slowly coming around.</p><p>I have been thinking about going to an outpatient program. I think mainly for mental health, but I think a dual diagnosis program that also focuses on addiction may also be helpful. I would like to see Jenabeth(my last therapist) for therapy again, but she won&rsquo;t see me until I do go to outpatient. That, and it seemed like the letter she sent me was almost a goodbye letter. Idk. I don&rsquo;t want to take that the wrong way, but I don&rsquo;t want to start over with someone new either :/ I&rsquo;m already going to start over with a new AA sponsor when I get one. I think I have someone in mind, but idk if she&rsquo;s sponsoring.</p><p>Anyways, life is good. Life is better sober. I am content with my life right now.

<p>I wrung my hands a few times after he sat down next me, just before the meeting started. He had asked me how I was doing I said getting by.</p>

<p>I looked him in the eye, which in times like these is not an easy task. I said “I need a sponsor.” So meekly, I was sure if it actually came out, should i clear my throat and repeat myself or carry on with what I want to say next, which was “that’s my next step”.</p>

<p>Before I could decide what to do he smiled and said “well you just asked me” and he winked. A sense of relief and calm came over me. </p>

<p>The meeting was about the 4th step, which is making a fierce moral inventory. For as long as I’ve known about that step after reading about it in JEs Freys “A Million Little Pieces.” (Still an important book to me regardless of the scandal.) the way he told it made it feel important and impossible all at the same time. Necessary and all together pants shittingly terrifying.</p>

<p>The reading, going around the table finished just before me, and so it was my turn to start the discussion. I said a polite version of the above and passed. Those who spoke after me had some really good things to say about the importance of the 4th step. I’m still scared. But I know I must when the time comes.</p>

<p>I also started in earnest and reading the big book. Just got to the “We Agnostic” chapter and that has been the big struggle. I do not know what I believe in, but I do know that I am very angry, and carry a lot of resentment towards the idea of the traditional higher power.</p>

<p>Spent the holiday with some friends and their kids. Ate good food. Have to work tomorrow. Not working in retail anymore is what I am most thankful for.</p>

<p>It was a good day. I am going to bed 5 days sober and when I wake up I will be 6 days sober.</p>"

","<p>I woke up this morning feeling so frustrated. I had dreams last night about smoking weed and another dream where my mom friends were talking shit about me for not drinking. And another dream where I was trying to save baby from drowning in a shallow sandy beach. </p>

<p>Last night me and Anthony(fromTinder) had plans.. Sorta. He was being really weird about making definite plans. Turns out he didn&rsquo;t get off work until late.. and didn&rsquo;t even come to Lexington. He never called to reschedule or say sorry. He just texted.</p>

<p>Maybe he is seeing someone else who he is really interested in. Or maybe he just isn&rsquo;t that interested in me. Maybe I really did scare him off&hellip; Oh Fucking Well. </p>

<p>I just want to let it go and not care anymore. For some reason I really care what this guy thinks of me. Maybe its cause he&rsquo;s so normal and has money and is successful and smart. Like.. Maybe I&rsquo;m seeking his approval - or society&rsquo;s approval.</p>

<p>Maybe I belong with Nachie lolololzzz :) </p>

<p>I am so broke. BEYOND broke. I need to be a lot more grateful at work. I have been doing my homework at work a lot&hellip; focusing on myself rather than my job. I totally fucked up my grade in CIT. blehh</p>

<p>I am nervous to go to my dads house today. Annette is sick. Her daughters will be there. I haven&rsquo;t seen them all in a long time&hellip;<br/>
I&rsquo;m glad Garrett is going too. </p>

<p>Today I hope I can let go of this Anger I feel. Anger towards Republican and CHRISTIANS and Anthony(fromTinder) and Anna by sponsor who hates me. Anger towards my old friends who don&rsquo;t care about me anymore. </p>

<p>I have Baby - A job I love - Success in School - </p>

<p>I am able to depend on myself today.. I know that other people do not make up my identity. My self worth comes from my accomplishments in school at work and in my personal life. </p>

<p>Other people should not affect my happiness because they don&rsquo;t have anything to do with what makes me me. </p>

<p>I VOW to try to be helpful to others. To volunteer &amp;&amp; keep trying to help Courtney. Maybe I will go to a meeting and share some hope. hehe Happy Thanksgiving.</p>"

One I hadn&rsquo;t been to. Small, we read from As Bill Sees It and had a discussion. </p>

<p>I admitted my stumble and they were all very encouraging. One of the passages was about the higher power and I said, like I said at the Saturday meeting all those weeks ago that I am having trouble with finding a higher power and that I am very angry and resentful at the traditional higher power. That I can not believe that there&rsquo;s is a being that loves me unconditionally and would allow what happened to me as a child to happen, to me or anyone. I take responsibility of the things I have done as an adult both to myself and others, but I was a child when the awful things happened to me. I trusted that person implicitly. </p>

<p>There was another passage about emotions that I&rsquo;m having trouble recalling, but it reminded me of a conversation I had with a someone at the Wednesday night meeting I went to about so many people say the hardest part about quitting drinking is admitting you&rsquo;re an alcoholic or asking for help. I&rsquo;ve heard this echoed time and time again even before I ever thought of going to AA. Hell, the very next day my new psychiatrist said it to me.<br/>
But what I&rsquo;ve heard in the rooms, from alcoholics and addicts is actually very different.</p>

<p>The hard part is not stopping drinking, the hard part is dealing with the emotions that come after, dealing with what you&rsquo;ve been running from with out using your out, and that truly is the hardest part.</p>

<p>I do not cope, I run. I was able to make it through the week for so long because I knew once the weekend came I could blackout. It worked like a pressure valve, if have those first few drinks and whatever carnival of trauma and depression and worry and anxiety was running amok in my head was shut down. The carneys were all given the night off and I could relax.</p>

<p>Until I tried to kill myself with a gallon of vodka that I drank in 2.5 hours.</p>

<p>Anthony who likes to go by Tony is a pharmacist/ lawyer who lives in Louisville in a nice house. He seems to do well for himself and is very handsome in a traditional suburbia Kentucky man way. The type of guy that a woman who is ready to settle down, get married &amp; have kids would LOVE to date. We met on Tinder and the first date we went on was a double date with Brooke and Gavin – who are also rich white people, so it seemed super appropriate. :) </p>

<p>I was seeing Dave Meal also when I first went on a date with Anthony. I thought I really liked Dave (turned out he was super clingy, kinda overweight, and VERY selfish), who has lots of tattoos and is a photographer. I thought Anthony was kinda boring and I felt insecure about him because he’s rich and I just thought he wasn’t into me. He talked to Gavin about stocks and basketball rather than paying attention to me.</p>

<p>After I ended things with Dave I went to Louisville and spent time with Anthony. We kissed and I started actually developing feelings for him. We made out while he was wearing sweatpants and his dick felt really big:). He always pays for dinner and he is successful and I want to be with someone like him. This weekend we hung out and he took me to a Basketball game. Afterword we hung out with his friends and I got really nervous and acted weird in front of them. </p>

<p>We met them at a Bar, and I don’t think it was so much the alcohol but just all the people I didn’t know. They were all older than me, rich, preppy, boring, white people. I mean.. I’m white too but I’m certainly not boring:). I felt really awkward and totally blew it with his friends. </p>

<p>After that we walked back to my place. He came in and we made out a little. He kept trying to go further but I wouldn’t let him. I have feelings for him and I was not willing to sleep with him and let him end up hurting me. He told me a story about a girl he met on Tinder who was a stripper, she was a mess and he kicked her out of his house. It was kinda a funny Tinder horror tale.. (kinda). I said what do you have against strippers? He said promise me your not a stripper. SWEAR YOU’VE NEVER BEEN A STRIPPER! So I told him the truth. &amp;&amp; I also told him why I quit. I quit because I went to rehab and got sober. It isn’t a glamorous story. </p>

<p>I feel so vulnerable sharing that part of my past with him. He seems like the type of man who’s had a perfect childhood. He is successful and super normal. I knew he would judge me. &amp; I really believe he does think less of me now. Anyway…</p>

<p>He spent the night and we cuddled. The next day I went to my family’s Thanksgiving party (which was amazing! The drinking didn’t bother me and I had a really great time) and he tailgated for the UK game. When I got home I texted him to see if he wanted to hang out but he was real weird and said he had to much to drink. I texted him the next morning (today) and he had already driven back to Louisville. He says he isn’t scared off by my past. But why didn’t he spend time with me today before heading home?</p>

<p>I just feel vulnerable. Dating someone who is successful and has money is really fun. It feels good that he is so into me. He always tells me how pretty I am. I don’t want to him to stop seeing me. I feel like my alcoholism makes me undatable. I don’t like to go to bars or be surrounded by people drinking. But for normal people – that’s just something that they do on the weekends. I make people feel weird around me. Unsure if they should drink, or they don’t invite me along because they do want to drink. For normal people drinking is fun, and is a big part of socializing. I’m the big wierdo who doesn’t drink. I think it’s why Brooke has decided to abandon our friendship…</p>

<p>But what do I do.. Only hang out with sober people?? Ughhh PLEASE NO. I love my sober friends but no. They can’t be it. I guess I just need to find away to enjoy myself even if there is alcohol around. And to not feel weird or like an outcast.</p>

<p>Tumblr I will keep you updated about Anthony, but for now I have to run because Nachie is here. Nachie is a story for a different day:).</p>"

Today I feel really let down by three people. My mom, my brother, and my friend Brooke. </p>

<p>My feelings towards my mom and my brother revolve around Family Thanksgiving on Saturday. My mom and Garrett will be drinking, and I feel so left out when they drink together. I just hate being different. I wish I could drink too. I feel like they care more about drinking than me and my feelings. Im a selfish for wanting them to be sober around me? Is that even what I want? :( I want to not be alcoholic. I want to be a normal person.</p>

<p>I hate being an alcoholic. I hate AA meetings, and hearing about GAWD. I don&rsquo;t really know if any of that shit is real or if it works for me or if I believe it. I want to stay sober. I love what my life has become.</p>

<p>As for Brooke.. She is a terrible friend. We had plans, she didn&rsquo;t pick up her phone, and didn&rsquo;t message me for days afterword. I messaged her tonight and said &ldquo;heyyy haven&rsquo;t heard from you whatsup?&rdquo; and no reply. I was thinking tonight.. and maybe its good that we stop being friends. She is very shallow and does not respect me. She promised she wouldn&rsquo;t drink around me and then did.. over and over again. I think she lies a lot and probably only wanted to be my friend when it was convenient for her. </p>

<p>People suck. Family Friends Fuck Buddyzz. All of them. I won&rsquo;t trust any of them. I can&rsquo;t let them effect my happiness. I must rely on myself for my happiness. I need to seek strength and peace from within myself. and REALLY IMPORTANt -&gt;&gt; I need to help someone. I REALLY need to help someone. </p>

Hope for the organization’s financial stability was pinned to the sale of their newly-published book; “Alcoholics Anonymous.” A small group of early AA members, including cofounder Bill Wilson, were discussing what to do. Morgan, a new member, had an idea. He had connections in the media from his days as an advertising man. He could arrange for an interview on a popular nationwide radio program. As the AA literature tells it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;[S]omebody sounded a note of caution: What if the lately released asylum inmate Morgan should be drunk the day of the broadcast! Hard experience told us this was a real possibility. How could such a calamity be averted?</p>

<p>&quot;Very gently we suggested to a resentful Morgan that he would have to be locked up somewhere until the night of the broadcast. It took all of salesman Henry’s wiles to put this one over, but he did…</p>

<p>&quot;Sighs of relief went up in every New York member’s home when Morgan’s voice was heard. He had hit the deadline without getting drunk. It was a heart-stirring three minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgan told a tale of alcoholic ruin and of the recovery he and others had found in AA.</p>

<p>What went on there? The group was so afraid Morgan would go on a binge, they locked him up so he could go on the air to tell how they helped him recover from his drinking problem. If hard experience told them he was likely to get drunk, how good was his &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;? If they didn’t have faith in his sobriety, how much faith did they have in their program?</p>","<i>More Revealed</i> by Ken Ragge<br/>"

This is unlikely to change anytime soon.

They did that because a) the recovery people had no advocacy organization, and b) it was a shame-based disease that they knew nobody was going to rise up and say anything about because most of the recovery people were member anonymous programs.

The author’s candor here is to be celebrated. She manaages to keep a sense of humor almost all the way through while detailing the dysfunctional behavior and “antics” of her alcoholic father and five generations of alcoholism and denial. In fact, the theme of denial seems to play out most of the way, tied to trips to the Cook County Hospital. The stories are funny and often unflattering, even profane, sometimes in a painful way, and to the author’s credit, she makes the reader laugh at dysfunction.  The author smartly includes a family tree in the back of the book, and she includes an index of family stories. The stories, of course, are the core of the memoir, both those observed and those passed along in family narratives. <br/></p><p><b>Structure, Organization, and Pacing:</b> 4</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Production Quality and Cover Design:</b> 4<br/></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Plot and Story Appeal:</b> 4</p><p><b>Character Appeal and Development:</b> 4</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Voice and Writing Style: </b>5</p>"

Communal AA does nothing to alter its members&rsquo; consciousness beyond the serving of a mild drug (caffeine) at its meetings, and, beyond admonitions, the use of low-key rituals, sacred texts, and group pressure, it does nothing to control their thoughts—with the significant exception of the use of thought-stopping jargon. In institutional AA, however, coerced participants are kept very busy, given little time alone, deprived of outside contacts, allowed to read only approved (that is, indoctrination) literature, forced into making false confessions, subjected to attacks, threats, and ridicule for raising questions or making critical comments, and subjected to extreme pressure by a unanimous majority to change their belief systems. Clearly, mind-control is the essence of institutional AA&rsquo;s indoctrination program.","AA: Cult or Cure? Second Edition by Charles Bufe"

After yesterday&rsquo;s stirred up emotions, worked from home. Binge watched the 100 season 2 on Netflix, until 1 am. Missed my 7 am meeting today. Cancelled the appointment with my therapist. I&rsquo;m in danger of being fired by my psychiatrist. My goals for my life are to comfort myself and reach out to othersin my life when issues arise. I isolated myself, and reaching out helps keep me connected and grounded. *******
Met with my sponsor this morning. She is super supportive. D she suggested I do the 1-2-3 waltz with the first three steps while working on sobering up, like for the first year. I like this idea. I&rsquo;m still seeking opportunities to restore integrity where out is out. And it&rsquo;s out as it comes to therapy. I need to be clearer with the therapist and psychiatrist about my intentions. Integrity, stripped off morality, is is about workability and empowerment.  This is how I want my life to be. *********
So step one, I feel lighter for having faced my mistrust in God having intentions to prosper and thrive me in continuity with my community. I have doubts about God even existing as well.  Someday s God seems inevitable. Been studying theology in my &ldquo;spare time&rdquo; for 3 years because I wanted to know more about God. And then, there is doubt about God&rsquo;s existence. I prayed for help setting God, for God not too forget me, as did the matriarchs of old, and I&rsquo;m still infertile and forgotten by God. Of God&rsquo;s all powerful, how could that happen? ******
Back to step one: my life is feeling much more manageable without alcohol. Blurry thoughts, and erratic emotions seems more stable. This is a better life than alcohol could ever give me. I&rsquo;m glad I binged on Netflix yesterday, not on alcohol. ******

After going i always feel so refreshed and calm. It’s such a wonderful feeling knowing i’m 4 days sober and i’m trying to help myself. Today they asked the people who are less than 30 days sober to introduce themselves and i actually did. I’m not ashamed of who I am, and there were two other men there. One was in his 30′s and he introduced himself to me and asked how many days sober i was, he was at 17 and apparently goes to my school too. It’s just nice to know i’m not alone, and today I went to open discussion and the subject was how we deal with not being spiritually fit with ourselves. </p><p>I have always never been one to like religion, it always kinda seemed like a cult to me, but seeing that a higher power has helped so many people who have felt the same exact way as me gives me so much hope. </p><p>But the topic was talking about dealing with looking at ourselves,<br/>and i realized that when i was 3 weeks sober during the summer I don’t think it worked because I wasn’t looking at a higher power, i was just reflecting on myself in the most negative way. I was looking at all of my fault and all of my wrong doings but I wasn’t looking at how I could look towards the future, i wasn’t looking at how i could take things one day at a time. And now just because these terrible things had happened to me, it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen for a reason and that I could learn to live with it and love myself. and I’m really excited to learn who i am sober. I’m ready to take things a day at a time and feel this kind of serenity everyday. </p><p>also i’m such a piece of shit every time i go to AA i always check out boys/girls and today during the closing prayer i was super excited cause i got to hold hands with a cute guy while we did it ahhahahhah </p>"

Step one, my life was out of control, and I&rsquo;m only seeking to live one day at a time now. Aa meeting this morning brought up some interesting things. //////
Background: I&rsquo;ve been in love with color forever. The brighter the better. Since the suicide, my motto has been, why live in one color when you can live in many? I&rsquo;ve been drawing, painting, doing paper art, I&rsquo;ve gotten pink highlights in my hair. I&rsquo;m expanding my use of color in my wardrobe. I attended a fine arts meeting yesterday and brought some work, as the committee requested work for holiday cards. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to print some of them up to sell, but been hesitant. Lots of doubt swirling around. The committee, however, loved what I showed them. They are going to print them up to send out. Won&rsquo;t cost me anything, and I get my work seen, I get to contribute. I was amazed. I love my art, but I&rsquo;m biased. It&rsquo;s a miracle and my dream is coming true without me striving to sell my works. ******so at aa today, the conversation was about time that challenge us and how to manage without alcohol. A lady mentioned trust in her higher power, that her higher power intended good things for her out of crisis and change. For me, that brings up trust issues. I&rsquo;ve just begun to trust that my fellow humans might want what is best for me, with altruism. How can God though? There are so many stories of God smiting and punishing. And then there were the cards to be printed. And my husband found me before I died from my attempt at ending my life. And the doctor that saved my life when birth alone should have killed me. And, I don&rsquo;t want to trust God.  There&rsquo;s so much that had happened that I&rsquo;m blaming God for causing. Too much to list here.  ****** That&rsquo;s where I am today. I&rsquo;m glad for the people I my life, and I&rsquo;m paying for the courage to trust God again. </p>"

Aa meeting day 2 of 7. Really welcoming group. Being late irritates me about myself. Still, I&rsquo;m glad I went and had the opportunity to listen and be still. The ladies of the group have me their numbers and encouraged me to come back, on their own. Moved and touched by their kindness and generosity.////////////
What I appreciate about myself today is: the ability to be flexible. Yesterday, I did phone triage, and orders, mostly alone. By the end of the day, I felt very overestimulated. The plan was for spinning class, but the thought of more loud noises seemed wrong.  Adjusting the plan, I came home, ate dinner, rested for an hour watching black books. Then came prep work for breakfast and lunch today, followed by 30 minutes bodyweight strength training. I got in the workout, and took care off myself at the same time. Love it!❤//////////
Finally, a personal goal is to begin working the 12 steps. Step 1: we admitted we were powerless over alcohol- that our lives had become unmanageable. ****** I want to think I&rsquo;m in control and a drink here and there won&rsquo;t hurt me. Over and over, this belief overwhelms all the evidence to the contrary. There are times when I don&rsquo;t know how I got where I got, so drunk. Thoughts of my suicide attempt came up y yesterday, the ultimate sign of powerlessness. I&rsquo;ve had suicidal thoughts for years, and never acted on them. The mother of these thoughts its all the guilt and shame and feelings of worthlessness buried deep in my psyche. So today, I&rsquo;m meditating on the contradiction in my brain, that I think, I want, I believe I&rsquo;m in control, but I&rsquo;m am addict and I&rsquo;m not powerful as it comes to alcohol, indeed, I&rsquo;m powerless. //// I&rsquo;m happy today. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of people pulling for my success. It&rsquo;s still puzzling to me as to why, but I&rsquo;m happy, and enjoying the happiness.</p>"

I lived in the city. Life was great, crazy, busy, stressful, encouraging and exciting. I worked hard, played hard and drank hard. That is what all professionals in the big city did. When my life crumbled around me, my drink became a necessity. It was the only way I could cope with life&hellip;especially after I lost everything from the financial economical crash.

The big city had failed me so I moved to the small town in the mountains to be close to my family. My father was losing his life to a terrible disease. This was where I escaped from reality. My nights got longer, my mornings more fuzzy. I started losing muscle all over my body. I had no desire to eat anymore. My family was becoming worried. I started to isolate and hide my liquor from everyone. 

That last night, I remember the bartender pouring my favorite shot of tequila and opening the wine. The next morning I was thinking of the night before. I had no idea what had happened. I found out from others that I had fallen in the bar. I seemed fine. I had driven them all home. They thought it was funny, but I was horrified inside listening to them. I knew my drinking was out of control and I needed help.

I walked into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and my life changed. I learned how to live without a drink. I made true female friends. Lots of them. I got true with myself. I made things right. I got healthy and I was living for the first time in my life. 

I am writing this blog because I have made a decision to go back to the big city. My gut tells me this is what I need to do, although I am scared to death. Writing out my feelings &ldquo;should&rdquo; provide some relief as I venture into this anxiety provoking adventure SOBER!!! I hate to leave this little town that I have come to love so much. This is my comfort zone. But it is time for this girl to go back and face life on lifes terms in my city of opportunity. With Alcoholics Anonymous on my side, I know I can do this!</p>"

The author wrote and asked us readers to message her with what we love about ourselves. I wrote about my hair in all its wildness and curls. It was very empowering. I was thinking that since I need to develop my self care and acceptance, perhaps a daily love me entry might be in order for reinforcement. Here we go!





Packed up breakfast and lunches yesterday. Got up early and went to  7 a.m. aa meeting. A little uncomfortable to be there, but I needed it to help with my addiction. The group was welcoming. The prep helped me arrive on time. Went to work feeling calm, instead of hurried, frazzled, as I usually do. 






I love that I can be flexible in my out look, if I remember to choose it. Today there is no one to answer the phones, so here I am, doing that and my regular Monday stuff, my flexibility and prep work are helping me be a team player today. Ion I&rsquo;m grateful for that. </p>"

We must face our own ugliness. We must become painfully aware of the unworkability of a pattern before we&rsquo;re willing to give it up. It often seems that our lives get worse rather than better when we begin to work deeply on ourselves. But life doesn&rsquo;t actually get worse. It&rsquo;s just that we feel our own transgressions more because we are no longer anesthetized by unconsciousness. We&rsquo;re no longer distanced, through denial or dissociation, from ourselves. We&rsquo;re starting to see the truth about the games we play. This process can be so painful that we are tempted to go backwards. It takes courage - often called the path of the spiritual warrior - to endure the sharp pains of self-discovery rather than choose to take the dull pain of unconsciousness that would last the rest of our lives.","Marianne Williamson,<i> A Return to Love</i><br/>"

cliques at school and the infinite fakeness that surrounded me completely
repulsed me. Tired of living a lie and carrying the burden of denial, I was no

pores, whilst the masquerade cruelly lived on. </p><p>The
pagan ritual of dressing up for Halloween became a bitter reminder for me. People
pretending to be someone they were not, haunted my every thought. </p><p>For
solace, I read the letters from friends and boyfriends I collected since the
seventh grade—letters that used to make me laugh and bring me comfort. I
thought they were all lies—every last one of them. I questioned whether anyone ever
genuinely liked me or meant anything they ever wrote or said to me. </p><p>I
took the jack-o-lantern up to the attic along with a book of matches and my
collection of letters. I read each letter one last time. Then I tore them up, placed
the pieces inside the pumpkin, and watched them burn. Burning the letters did
not provide any relief or the cleansing feeling I hoped for. All it did was
erase any written proof against the crushing melancholy that was eating me up
inside. </p>"

One group was assigned to attend AA, another to attend an alcoholism treatment clinic, and a third group, the control, was not assigned to any treatment program. All of the study&rsquo;s subjects were followed for at least one full year following conviction. Results were calculated by counting the number and frequency of rearrests for drunkenness. Surprisingly, the no-treatment control group was the most successful of the three, with 44% of its members having no rearrests; 32% of those assigned to the clinic group had no rearrests; and 31% of those assigned to AA had no rearrests. As well, 37% of the members of the control group had two or more rearrests, while 40% of the alcoholism clinic attendees were arrested at least two times, and 47% of the AA attendees were arrested at least twice.","<i>AA: Cult or Cure?</i> Second Edition by Charles Bufe"

Thus, the twelfth tradition, a call to principled action, has been perverted into a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; excuse for unprincipled, dishonest action.","<i>AA: Cult or Cure?</i> Second Edition by Charles Bufe"

Someone eventually came over and asked me if I was okay, then took me inside. They were all very welcoming, which I didn&rsquo;t think would happen, I thought they&rsquo;d look down on me because of my age. They all told me how brave I was for managing to walk through those doors. They then started telling stories about their first meeting, the night was focused around me. They talked about what brought them there, tried to help me understand that addiction is a mental and physical illness. They told me to look for similarities in other people&rsquo;s stories. Then when the meeting was over all the women gave me their phone numbers. Then for the rest of the night I was receiving messages from these women, very supportive, kind messages. <br/>
My point is, it helped to have people understand. It helped to listen to all of these people talk. Being able to have someone to relate to is a huge relief and basically you don&rsquo;t have to suffer alone. </p>

<p>If you have an addiction issue I highly suggest going to a meeting even if sitting in a church hall reading a book doesn&rsquo;t sound helpful, God it&rsquo;s really comforting to be surrounded by people that understand and have been in the exact same position as you are now. Age doesn&rsquo;t matter. Do not let your age stop you from going because everyone told me they wish they had found meetings when they were my age. </p>

<p>They all said their success with sobriety was due to meetings. So if you do have a problem, PLEASE go to a meeting. I promise you, you&rsquo;ll find some comfort out of attending.</p>"

I can’t see straight, everythings blurry, my willingness is completely shot and I don’t know why I started my recovery in the first place, even though I know there are a million reasons.

That’s a new way of thinking about others that I previously wouldn’t have even thought about, that every person, not just other alcoholics that I meet are nowhere near emotional perfection (even though my head likes to tell me they are). Just like nobody is physically perfect (with the exception of Lana Parrilla XD) - everybody I come into contact with has their own struggles and problems.<br/><br/>I guess for me, I’m a lot more open now to a spiritual experience in the program, it is a spiritual program after all. I just have such a resentment against that idea that I really didn’t know I was still holding onto. Growing up with the idea of “one God” (the word God still makes me cringe) and then attending a rehab for 2 years that forced Christianity and bible living upon me daily has really screwed up my ability to think of a higher power in the program as anything other than what I’ve been made to believe.<br/><br/>Not that my experiences in rehab were necessarily bad, not that I didn’t have spiritual experiences while I was there - in hindsight I’ve never had more peace and contentment in my life, but I don’t like the idea of a cut and dry, labels and boxes God<br/><br/>And that’s why I like this program because the higher power that you choose to believe in could literally be anything that you personally deem fit. I’m still learning what that is for me. But all I know is I was shying away from it because it made me a bit uncomfortable. And without that connection, conscious contact and practice, I fell back and picked up.<br/><br/>It doesn’t matter if I don’t like doing the daily suggested things, I am way more open and committed to doing them now because I’m so fucking desperate not to pick up another drink again. I know I am powerless over alcohol and when I drink my life becomes unmanageable. Right now, my life feels unmanageable and I know it’s because I have been picking and choosing the parts of the program that I think I know work or don’t work for me.<br/><br/>In truth, I don’t know anything. I can’t control other people, their reactions; anymore than I can control places or things. All I can do is try and keep my side of the street clean, be honest, be open and be willing to believe that there is something out there, whatever that may be, greater than myself, greater than human knowledge that can help and guide me. Because without it, I’m fucked.<br/><br/>I don’t really know why I’m writing this - I guess I wanted to start my blog again and use this as a space to journal and really write out my thoughts and feelings honestly without using a pen and paper, because that crap hurts my hands :P<br/><br/>A spiritual program always sounds a bit wishy washy to me, and I’m an enormous skeptic. I find it very hard to believe in spiritual things without reverting back to that <i>fuck you Christianity </i>mindset. I really just have to put that aside and hope for a new experience in what I’m doing.<br/><br/>For me, I think a higher power, right now, is just that conscience in your gut, that still small voice. The serenity and peace you get from doing the right thing and being a decent human being. That small voice that says, don’t do that, you’ll only make it worse. Sometimes my head is so loud and I keep myself so damn busy that I drown the voice out. I don’t want that anymore, I need to find my own truth and listen to it, my gut instinct&hellip;I guess I’m just struggling and my head is literally all over the place at the moment. But the only thing that matters is that today - right now, I don’t need to pick up a drink, no matter how physically tired I am, no matter how much I don’t want to go to work and face life, I can do so, <i>somehow</i>, without needing a drink.<br/><br/>To go from being a daily drinker who couldn’t get out of bed in the morning unless I had half a bottle of scotch down my throat, to being able to feel uncomfortable but do the damn things I need to do anyway - that is something beyond my control. The fact that I’m not incessantly blind drunk every minute of the day is something beyond my control. They didn’t happen by my own self will or knowledge. It happened because of something I don’t even understand - but I am so grateful. I think, right now, being willing to believe and putting suggested things into practice with an open mind is all I can do.</p><p><i>One day at a time.</i></p>"

I’m hurting, a lot. Tomorrow would’ve been my 7 months. I’ve come so far, learnt so much, I thought I was so much stronger than picking up! But now my sobriety date will be the 20th of October 2015 rather than the 23rd of March 2015.<br/><br/>I am so fucking disappointed in myself - without sounding like a self-pitying whinger. I was so proud of my recovery and how far I had/have come, and to pick up over an insignificant detail such as a slightly annoying day at work&hellip;that’s unfathomable to me. It really made me understand the nature of this disease. Cunning. Baffling. Powerful.<br/><br/>I’ve been to 4 meetings in 2 days. I’ve started my morning meditations again, which I told myself I had been doing, but in reality only did about twice a week if that. I’ve been throwing myself into the fellowship again, calling my sponsor daily, going to 2 meetings a day, spending my free time with other older sober members. I feel really lost right now tbh.<br/><br/>I know I only drank one pint and somehow was able to stop. But gosh damn it, it so wasn’t worth it! I know I should’ve been going to more meetings and being way more attentive to my spiritual and emotional health than I was. I shouldn’t have slacked off my home group responsibilities.<br/><br/>But it’s okay - every day is a new day and every day is another day I don’t need to pick up; even when the cravings have returned with a vengeance I have honestly never experienced before. I do not need nor want to drink, that’s just a lie my head keeps telling me.<br/><br/>Sigh sigh sigh. 2 days sober. I know it’s only a change in date and it doesn’t wipe out every single thing I’ve achieved up until this point in recovery! It sure does feel like it sometimes. Just grateful that I could walk back in the doors of AA less than 12 hours after I picked up and be welcomed back, encouraged, hugged and supported. This fellowship freaking saved my life.<br/><br/>So grateful to be sober, to have an incredible network of supportive friends, family, parents!

During the meeting, he kept walking towards me and placing various items in front of me. The third time he did it caused me to exchange worried glances with a few different people, including the general secretary. After the meeting, I bolted home because I didn’t want the creepy guy to engage me in conversation. Later in the evening, I received a text from one of the women - she said that her boyfriend (the general secretary) had mentioned the creepy guy and she wanted to make sure everything was ok. She gave me some advice for what to do if that happens again, and she said that her boyfriend was going to talk to the guy and tell him that his behavior wasn’t cool.</p><p>I originally was going to write about how creepy the guy was, but then I realized that that detail wasn’t the important part of the story.

Even though some days are painful, and I think to myself “Gosh, wouldn’t it be nice (cough*EASIER) if I could just go back to being ignorant, but thats not how I really feel. Thats my disease speaking to me. Learning to separate myself from my disease and having the awareness of it, is quite the powerful gift, that truly I am so grateful my higher power has given me. But when I struggle- and my disease speaks, I try to calm myself and listen to that inner most deep voice. The voice inside me that doesn’t use words. MY GUT.

","<p>One week ago I went to an AA meeting. I did so on a whim of sorts. I was drinking to blackout again, and I left my parents&rsquo; BBQ with a six pack they sent along because they don&rsquo;t drink. I&rsquo;m driving and I realize I need to stop drinking, NOW. I call my friend and I say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing over some beer because I don&rsquo;t trust myself&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m on my way there and I realize: I have a problem. If I have to leave beer with friends because I can&rsquo;t quit drinking, I need something more. So I pull over and I google AA meetings and there&rsquo;s one at 10pm and its 20 minutes away and I look at my clock. 9:24. And I turn my car around and I go to a meeting. I got so much support and so many phone numbers and help with a plan to dispose of the beer (the plan was to get it out of my car, set it the fuck down, and drive away quickly). I said I would come to the meeting the next day. I did not. </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t drink either, though. I stayed sober and one week later, tonight, I&rsquo;m out with friends. Just as we are leaving, at 5:30pm,  I remember there is a meeting at the same location at 5:45pm. This time I am only 10 minutes away. I turn toward the meeting, and I go, and it&rsquo;s inspiring again and I had a great experience. </p>

<p>Am I going to go tomorrow? Probably not. But I know I will go back to AA. I don&rsquo;t know how soon, but as they say: one day at a time. </p>

more excruciating hours have passed. After pestering the guard in front of the
triage unit several times, Dan and I convinced him to let us in to inquire
about Dad’s condition. He has been here for ten hours now, and we have not
heard a thing. When we peered into the triage unit window earlier, we saw they
hooked Dad up to an IV drip, but that was all we were able to make out. The
clerk at the triage desk directed us to the emergency room, where Dad was being
treated. </i></p><p><i>The
on call doctor, Dr. Wilson and his nurse, Rochelle could hardly wait to relay
the following story to us: Every time Dr. Wilson tried to explain to Dad that he
had diabetes, Dad yelled “Stroke!” in a Polish accent and pointed his index finger
high up into the air. Dad did not let Dr. Wilson finish saying the word
“diabetes” before he interrupted him by yelling “Stroke!”</i></p><p><i>“Diabetes.”</i></p><p><i>“Ssstroke!”</i></p><p><i>“Diabetes.”</i></p><p><i>“Ssstroke!”</i></p><p><i>Dr.
Wilson checked Dad’s chart and noticed his last name was Velesovsky. Thinking
Dad spoke Polish, he requested an interpreter. Five minutes later, an
interpreter was summoned to the room. </i></p><p><i>“Thank
you for coming. Please explain to the patient his blood work indicates he is a
diabetic. We will be administering an intravenous antibiotic drip to help fight
the infection in his foot and will be giving him insulin to control his blood
sugar levels. However, he will most likely lose a couple of his toes.”</i></p><p><i>As
requested, the interpreter translated Dr. Wilson’s message to Dad in Polish. </i></p><p><i>Dad
listened intently to the interpreter and said, “Hey, Doc. I don’t know what the
hell this guy is saying. Do you?”</i></p><p><i>The
truth is Dad does not speak a word of Polish. The reason he kept saying
“stroke” was he fell down the basement stairs about six months ago and heard a
loud pop when his head hit the floor. Any reasonable person would know the
sound he heard was his skull banging into the concrete. Dad, however, was
convinced he had a stroke and the popping sound he heard was a blood vessel
exploding in his head. That was why his fingers and toes were numb. It had
nothing at all to do with him having untreated diabetes, or the fact he was a
raging alcoholic for most of his adult life—nope, nothing at all. Clearly, the
man is in bitter denial. </i></p><p><i>Dad’s

and I followed Dr. Wilson down the hall. He stopped by the door which led to
the treatment area and said, “Please wait here.”</i></p><p><i>Sure,

When I think of how old I’ll be when I graduate law school (28), how old I’ll be when I pass the bar (29), how I’ll be when I contact him again (29), I feel like it’s not even worth it. </p><p>Instinctively I know that 29 isn’t old. Hell, I don’t want to get married until I’m 31+, but The One is almost a decade older than me, and I don’t want to marry him at 40. We’ll only have 35 years together before he dies. And that’s if he’s even single. He said he wasn’t planning to date between now and then, but people always fall in love when they don’t expect to. The entire Hollywood film industry is premised on this notion! </p><p>I realize how fucking ridiculous this post looks. Like, I totally understand how obscenely stupid it is to freak the fuck out about something that is going to happen in two and a half years. Like, let’s focus on finishing this semester of law school, or contemplate reaching 60 days of sobriety (which is in October). Hell, if I’m feeling super forward looking, I should think about finding a job for next summer or my one year sober birthday (August 2016). But no, I’m thinking about what I’ll text someone when I’m 29. WTF?</p>"

Y’know it’s hard to say what just happened but I do know I’m closer to getting fucked up as shit than ever. Sure I’ve done a few Xanax and Lunesta since I got out of the hospital but that’s it really. I feel Fucking soul-dead and lost. 

Keep in mind I’ve been doing any drug I can get my hands on for about 6 or 7 years now.

</p><p>I haven’t drank since May 14 of 2014, same day I checked into one of the best rehabs on the east coast. BUT that really doesn’t mean SHIT. I got out needed that damn Adderall and later Dexedrine to not drink and it ended me up right back in an institution. Bullshitted the docs good I know. Hey, I TOLD THIS GUY I WAS AN ADDICT TOO HAH!</p><p>Anyway I found a sponsor, and what does he say “Whatever you saw in that girl that you thought was crazy, you were projecting out the same things which attracted her” when I was telling him only a bit about it. I just thought wow. NO shit, man?!! Wowwowow. Basically he meant I’m just as sick, yeah&hellip;Well I guess that was why she was appealing (other than being beautiful) and I still don’t know what the fuck to feel about that right now. </p><p>Thank God I found a sponsor quickly though being in and out of the rooms before I never had a sponsor and had a bad experience last year (fucked up on Ritalin after staying up all night) and never thought I’d go back. Luckily I found a girl I had met in rehab years ago that I hit up on FB randomly I asked if she was still in recovery, she showed me a Drug Addicts Anonymous meeting that was really chill. Some guy there latched on to me and convinced me to go back to the local town meeting hot spot where me and my friend were accosted last year (after said Ritalin binge) - “Ya’ll too YUNG TO BE ALKKKAHOLICS!” said friend is now dead. </p><p>Mother of fuck. I’m 26, I know how to drink like a gentleman. I’m white chipping again and I’m giving this another shot. I’m powerless over my life and helpless to addiction and alcoholism. I gotta worry about myself and not try to hunt down the next fix *cough* girls included #liesialreadyambutineedtoNOT  God bless you all out there struggling with addiction. Hey, I know I’m starting a fucking novel. This is tumblr, after all , and #thatisall</p>"

It’s one of the most complicated diseases to have because of the stigma and disgust around it and we cannot help it, it’s the way our brains are wired. So many people say to me (even other addicts), you don’t look like an addict! But you’re perpetuating the stereotype, and if you’re an addict, putting down yourself. What does an addict LOOK like? </p>

<p>It’s a hidden disease. Full of shame and guilt and that only perpetuates the isolation and using. </p>

<p>I have an amazing job, a great apartment, loving family, I’m smart. My mind is diseased and it can happen to anyone. I am the cause of my own problems because my brain is sick and 95% of people are uneducated about this. No wonder I feel alone. Until we start embracing this as a disease, just like cancer, we will not move forward.</p>

<p>The problem is, with addiction, you ruin relationships, as a result of your disease NOT because you don’t care. With cancer, people run to your bedside with flowers. Addiction manifests itself in behavior and that’s why it’s a hard pill to swallow for families, friends. </p>

<p>I would equate it to similar feelings of being transgendered, never feeling right in your own body. The drugs are a SYMPTOM of our disease. The disease haunts us every day from a normal life. There is no cure. Imagine your brain telling you every day, you’re not ok. </p>

<p>Please, do not punish your loved addict by abandoning them, they need your love. They hate themselves enough for what they did to you, but they have no control over themselves. Imagine what that feels like. </p>

<p>If you want to debate this with me, please do. We have to talk about this as a society. We have to support addicts. </p>

<p>This disease feeds on shame, guilt and isolation. I want to break the cycle.</p>"

Though I don’t practice the twelve steps and did not believe in their efficacy when I briefly tried to, I reject that term—I wasn’t brainwashed. I was brain-baptized. To many, baptism is a bizarre and somewhat cruel ritual during which Christians mark infants as their territory by dumping water on their heads and renouncing Satan on a baby’s behalf. It is a way for churches to cook the books, adding members to their rosters that didn’t have the option of declining the invitation. It is an understandable critique. But where I used to concentrate on the helpless baby in baptism, now all I can see is the best intentions of the congregation. They too are susceptible to the darkness. But they extend promises of safe passage to the child presented before them, abandoning their own self-centered preoccupations in order to focus on the ones that cannot guide themselves toward the light alone.","Alana Massey, “<a href=""http://www.damemagazine.com/2014/09/23/where-sick-go-become-well"" target=""_blank"">Where the Sick Go to Become Well</a>,” <i>Dame Magazine</i>"

However I need some help or I&rsquo;m going to die. And to get that help I think the first step that I feel I need to do is talk about this problem I&rsquo;m having. I went to a rehab in New Hampshire after multiple previous attempts to get sober. When I agreed to go to this rehab I was in a pretty sad place in my life. I never left the room that I was living in with my boyfriend, the rest of the house was rented by his schizophrenic mother and I sat there all day shooting up staring at the tv but not really watching it listening to his mother talk to the man in the ceiling. There was no real relief anymore. We had both overdosed multiple times already and I&rsquo;d been arrested twice one right after another. The police had taken my car the second time along with my license and my mom had just said that she wished I would just hurry up and die so she could collect on my life insurance. She&rsquo;d said this to my boyfriend because she had stopped talking to me a long time before that and had given up on the fact that I would ever be the daughter she knew again. So I went to this rehab without paying attention to what the man who ran the place said about it. I just agreed to go knowing that this would be just like all the other places I went to. But I was wrong. I got there and it blew me away. I&rsquo;d gone to aa before but I think this was the first time I really heard the message. They were all addicts or alcoholics and they took us through the big book and steps 1-3 the first two weeks and then if we chose to stay longer allowed us another 2-4 weeks to stay and write a fourth step and read it to someone there. And I stayed. It was the first time that I had hope that I would stay sober. I went to one of their sober houses after. But I didn&rsquo;t stay sober I relapsed. And two weeks later I was back in detox going back to that rehab who sent me back to their sober house in the hopes that this time I was really serious. And I was or I thought I was and so did every one else. This time I stayed at their sober house 5 months and the day my sponsor told me I could start raising my hand to sponsor and a staff member was teaching me how to go through the book with one of the new girls I relapsed again. Again I was given some faith and the other sober house I was supposed to move into came and got me. But I relapsed again. This time there was no faith left. Ever since I have been home struggling with myself on whether to get sober or not. I&rsquo;ve burnt all the bridges in Portland all contact with me was stopped immediately. And it frustrates me when I hear people say in here that aa never left them. Because before I came back down here and was homeless on the streets of Portland I walked into a meeting to uncomfortable glances and muttered hellos if I approached anyone to say hi. I would say my introduction hello my name is Olivia and I&rsquo;m an addict and an alcoholic and i received muted hi Olivia&rsquo;s from a few people in the room. These were people I had gotten sober with together at the same rehab many of us went to the same sober house afterwards or id become friends with them through meetings. I&rsquo;d talked to them when they were feeling down. Id given them my phone number. We&rsquo;d gone out to dinner together. Supported each other in hard times. They were the people who said they&rsquo;d be there no matter what. But suddenly they weren&rsquo;t. My sponsor had told me that one of the staff members at that sober house i was at for five months had told her that I just wasn&rsquo;t ready. When my mom called that rehab for me because I was in psych ward and couldn&rsquo;t get ahold of them they told her that I&rsquo;d been there too many times that year which was understandable and again said that I just wasn&rsquo;t ready. So here I am back home in Massachusetts and those words keep coming back to me. Again I&rsquo;ve overdosed a couple of times back to back. There&rsquo;s no relief and there hasn&rsquo;t been since before I went to that rehab the first time. And I want more than anything to stop. To be ready. But how do I know that I&rsquo;m ready? Because so many times I&rsquo;ve gone through this and thought that I was ready. But I wasn&rsquo;t because I relapsed. So how can I tell? I can&rsquo;t stop using and I went to another rehab hoping that anywhere else could help me but I made another excuse for myself like we all do. But it didn&rsquo;t feel like an excuse it just wasn&rsquo;t the same I heard a bunch of cbt that I felt went against all the step work i had done. I could only talk to my sponsor for 10 minutes a day which was difficult because she had allowed me to continue writing tenth step until we went back through the steps and I began another fourth step but I couldn&rsquo;t read it because I needed way more than 10 minutes on the phone with her. And half the girls there were on suboxone and definitely didn&rsquo;t want to be there but were forced by the court to be there. So I felt like i was in a shitty environment. Everything after that rehab felt second to it. The steps this time felt watered down. And I was frustrated going to meetings and no longer finding support. So I went back to Massachusetts where I thought I&rsquo;d try going to meetings and find a new sponsor and live out in the real world with the living skills the sober houses had taught me and I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten. But I forgot where I was going back to. My mom asked me to sell her pills for her and then the next week she asked me to buy her pills for her which started a slew of people now texting my phone all day that I shouldn&rsquo;t be talking to. I didn&rsquo;t have my license but she was sending me out in her car to go pick them up which was again going against my program. And then my ex contacted me hearing I was buying and selling percs and it started that all over again and now I feel stuck because id left him so many times hoping that we&rsquo;d both get sober and we never did and now he was dying. He had gotten a blood infection and keeps overdosing and getting arrested and I know it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before I get the phone call. So now I don&rsquo;t know what to do and I am begging for help because I want to be ready and I want support im asking for aa not to turn their backs on me because of my chronic relapse story or because of my heroin addiction. I&rsquo;m going to die or I&rsquo;m going to live a very sad empty life and I don&rsquo;t want that anymore. Anything will help. I&rsquo;m Olivia I&rsquo;m an addict and an alcoholic thank you</p>"

Days sober: 9<br/>
Mood: Adrift and lost</p>

<p>“Well, when you drink or take pills can you ever just have one or do you want them all” My friend asked me this week, albeit a little bit too excited as to the perspective of my addiction. “I can never have one. Not ever. I always have to have to have just enough. Enough to get as blasted as I can with there always being a chance of over dose buy never enough so I actually know I will”. I replied sombrely. </p>

<p>This was the interaction that happened between myself and one of my friends this week. They are hardcore in rehabilitation with their addictions and I admire that, but in some ways it has become their life, and that is what has brought me to this post today. </p>

<p>Here’s the plain and simple truth: I am an addict. If it can get me stoned high drunk whatever I want it and I want to try it. I cannot tell you how many times I have contemplated taking the coke I was offered at a party, buying some mdma or ketamine off my friends. I have even shopped for stronger opiates like heroin through friends of friends. I have never actually done anything more then the fore mentioned narcotics, but I have wanted to and I have seriously considered it. If I didn’t have people who would have been pissed I would have, I know I would have. I am an addict. But I can’t help but ask is that all I am? </p>

<p>Every single day I think about them, my loves, my drugs. Every day multiple times a day, and every day, for the past few days anyway, I have resisted. But i can’t help but ask if there is a point? It seems that addiction world is divided. There are those like my friend, who make meetings and sobriety their life. Their everything. This is one of the most admirable things I think anyone can do: but I don’t want that life. Then there are those who say they aren’t addicts, and they surround themselves with their best friends daily, shooting up popping pills and snorting to their hearts content, often destroying their lives in the process: I also don’t want this. Then there are people like me. People who don’t go to meetings, who try to ignore or hide their cravings, who try to be normal but still deal with their addictions every day. People like me from what I have seen do not and cannot stay in this zone however, as it always seems they are drawn from one like magnets being pulled to their sides. But what about me? What about those who do not want to have a side. Who want to be normal and simple and not go to meetings but also not struggle. </p>

<p>I am an addict, but is an addict me? Who am I in this world. What am I. I am addicted to some, but not enough to be hardcore, but too much to be normal. Why does this quality have to define me? Why is it that this quality is all some want to focus on. There are addicts but am I one? </p>

<p>I find myself to be confused and stuck in this limbo of wanting to be better, healthier, and happier, but of also wanting to have a life outside of my problems not letting them be my life. Is this possible? Can I be better like this? Or is addiction, depression, and all that a permanent part of me. What if I don’t want it to be? How do I change that? What if I can’t? These thoughts plague me so. </p>

<p>Any responses are welcome.</p>

The thought bubbled and burst and bounced in my brain, and I suddenly remembered that I had two bottles of champagne at home. My ex had bought me the bottles a few months ago because he knew how much I loved peach champagne, and I had forgotten about the bottles because I was back home for the summer. </p><p>So, I sat in the meeting, thinking about that peach champagne. How good it would be, how delicious, how I would feel upon that first sip. After the meeting, I got up and went to Starbucks and ordered hot peach tea. I went home, took a long shower, and drank my peach tea. This morning, on my way to school, I placed the two bottles on a table in my apartment’s lobby with a sign that said “Free alcohol.” The bottles were gone by the time I got home a few hours later. </p>"

The past year of my life has, without a doubt, been one of my best. I have grown both personally and professionally and I owe all of that to my sobriety. Although I am no longer actively involved with AA I use the tools I learned from the program on a daily basis. I have been asked by friends and family throughout the year what I feel like I have gained in sobriety and it is really just peace. I see myself differently and I see other people differently. I face parts of myself I would never have faced before. Parts of my past resentments creep in and I muster up the courage or energy to look at them. I pay attention to my role in tricky situations. None of this is easy but all of it is worth it. I still have days where I imagine having a drink and then I remind myself what drinking actually means for me and I set myself straight. In the past year I have fallen in love, I have pushed myself academically and been accepted into a social work program, I have gotten a second job and I have moved out of my mother’s house. My relationships with friends and family are loving and honest. I am strong and willing to work on myself every single day. I continue to try to not hate my body and what I have done to it. I continue to try to not push my significant other away when I feel vulnerable. I continue to try to not resent my family and friends for certain things that may have done in the past. I continue to try to not resent myself for a whole lot of what I have done in the past. </p><p>Every thing is better and beautiful. I am blessed.</p>"

 I was in my usual state, drunk and sad. Masking it by being annoyingly energetic. But I saw that message and I fell to the ground. I let gravity take everything from me. Of course, teenage boys being teenage boys, they started laughing. That is when the tears begun. That is when I forgot where I was, who I was, and that their were eight shitty boys in my living room. <br/>
All I could focus on was how the carpet felt against my face and how bad my throat stung from the bottle of rum I drank, alone, on the bathroom floor, an hour earlier. <br/>
I was halfway between dead and Jupiter before someone finally asked what happened. I whispered, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to die.&rsquo; 
I remember their laughter. The laughter of the heartless boys in my living room. The laughter over a potential dead friend. Maybe I was fucked up, but they were the devils sons. <br/>
Then the boy in the back, the dark one, with the eyes that never really looked. The one who I was always trying to make see. He grabbed me, well, held me. He held me, while I was dying. 
I think something changed in me that night. It was the first time I had ever been really cared for, I have never had somebody look me in the eyes and say everything I&rsquo;ve needed to hear. 
We kissed.
He came over everyday after that.
I fell in love with him. <br/><br/>
Earlier today I was sitting on a bench outside of a court room. My partner in crime told me about you. The girl on the coach and you. She told me about everything that happened while I was regretting being born for two weeks straight. <br/>
That was my last chance of letting myself love. I want you to know that you took that away from me.

<p>That thought always lingered. That bit of advice was the thing that kept me from tipping over the edge. Now, I mean tipping over the edge like- ending up in prison or dead. My life still deteriorated before my eyes in what I believed was moderation. My moderation was binging on one thing for 2 weeks to 2 months, switching it to the next, and to the next, in a cycle- that way.. it&rsquo;s moderation right? Except now, this balance or the previous moderation has a whole new meaning.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve been sober for 3 and a half months today. Sometimes I feel balanced, but most times I&rsquo;m extremes. I&rsquo;ve been paying close attention to these highs and lows, and attempting to bare witness to if there are any triggers or not. The important thing for me, is to ask my higher power for guidance, inspiration, and intuition to carry out it&rsquo;s will and to remain faithful that each high, and each low, is to serve a greater purpose for which I just do not know what that is- yet. I am a strong believer for nothing goes away until it has taught you the lesson you are to learn. Each low shows us our defects, new and old; and each high brings on new faith. Last week, I just went through the lowest low I&rsquo;ve experienced in an incredibly long time. During it, my faith was non existent. I prayed and begged, pleaded and pleaded but to me it just felt like bogus words. It didn&rsquo;t have any emotion or faith attached to it. However, this low had a different effect on me because even though I couldn&rsquo;t feel it, I still prayed. I got to meetings each day, I reached out to program peeps and my sponsor each day, and as a result I wasn&rsquo;t isolating. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it was a torturous week, but now as I come around to reality again I&rsquo;m able to see a change in my reaction to the detour which encourages me for the next tough stretch.</p>",""

<p><img src=""http://thestoryplant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Trust-Me-Coming-Soon.jpg""/></p>

<div class=""entry"">
<p>Everyone loves a redemption story. It’s the basic theme of almost every ancient saga, classic novel, and Hollywood movie ever made. Read any book on writing and  you’ll probably get advice on how to take a flawed character, give him or her a problem, and let the resolution of the conflict be the logical outcome of the individual’s moral regeneration (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Redemption as reflected in storytelling is also the essence of addiction recovery. When an alcoholic named Bill Wilson listened to his friend Ebby’s tale of freedom from his drink problem, he in turn took his own story of transformation out to other drunks. After his first success, with a doctor named Bob Smith, he and the doctor went on to found Alcoholics Anonymous, a fellowship based on the telling of tales of redemption.</p>
<p>When I first tried to shop my latest book<em>, Trust Me, </em>I was told by agents that the main character wasn’t sympathetic enough. Why, they said, would a reader invest their time in following a story about a self-centered two-bit drug dealer? Who cares? I got the same critique from my editor when he sent me back <em>Down Solo</em>: make this drug addict likeable enough that we want to root for him. So I had some work to do, and I hope I did it adequately.</p>
<p><em>Trust Me</em> draws from a number of real-life stories and characters close to my heart. A mash-up of ex-girlfriends gave me the characters Holly and Lilah, deeply troubled but fundamentally decent people in real life and in the novel. The journalist is modeled after a man named Chuck whom I greatly respect, while the homicide detective—well, I never had a healthy relationship with cops back in the day, so I had to invent him entirely.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away, I can tell you that Art, the manipulative self-help guru who causes so much trouble in <em>Trust Me</em>, is based on a real person, a doctor in the recovery community in Los Angeles. In life he was actually an affable guy, charming and seemingly helpful, but he had a creepy side that led to behavior that laid the seeds for what would become—years later—this novel.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s Jeff, the loser that gets caught up in it all. His story of redemption mirrors my own, and it was great fun to fictionalize some of the darker—and goofier—events from the “what I was like” days.</p>

<p>SEEDS OF FAITH</p>

<p>Faith, to be sure, is necessary, but faith alone can avail nothing. We can have faith, yet keep God out of our lives.</p>

<p>— TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 34</p>

<p>As a child I constantly questioned the existence of God. To a &ldquo;scientific thinker&rdquo; like me, no answer could withstand a thorough dissection, until a very patient woman finally said to me, &ldquo;You must have faith.&rdquo; With that simple statement, the seeds of my recovery were sown!</p>

<p>Today, as I practice my recovery – cutting back the weeds of alcoholism – slowly I am letting those early seeds of faith grow and bloom. Each day of recovery, of ardent gardening, brings the Higher Power of my understanding more fully into my life. My God has always been with me through faith, but it is my responsibility to have the willingness to accept His presence.</p>

<p>I ask God to grant me the willingness to do His will.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

<p>How easily I can become misdirected in approaching the Eighth Step! I wish to be free, somehow transformed by my Sixth and Seventh Step work.

We were prepared to look at it from an entirely different angle. We began to see that the world and its people really dominated us. In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill. How could we escape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how?

Avoid meetings where sponsorship is mentioned too much. If someone talks about there sponsor stay away from them. Whatever you do: do not get a sponsor. They are lethal. 

They will try to have sex with you, or steal your money, or turn you into a zombie newcomer killer.

</p><p>4. Avoid meetings where they tell you alcoholism is a disease, especially a fatal one.</p><p>5. Avoid the big book - it talks about God too much. And the 12 &amp; 12, it talks about sponsors too much.</p><p>6. Avoid people that talk about Bill W. too much. Ask any of Bill’s contemporaries and they’ll tell you “hey will try to have sex with you, or steal your money, or turn you into a zombie newcomer killer.”

</p><p>7. Avoid people that talk about Dr. Bob too much. They are religious. Religion is deadlier than alcoholism.</p><p>8.

They really should start reading daily The Big Book; Twelve Steps &amp; Twelve Traditions; AA Comes of Age; Dr. Bob &amp; the Good Oldtimers and Pass it on.

<br/></p><p>First of all you don’t have to agree the Big Book to be an AA member (though you do have to agree with me!) The Big Book and the 12 &amp; 12 are very old books and full of old fashioned ideas and language. It would be better if these, and all the history books were taken out of circulation and new ones written (though they’ll need to be run by me first of course!) <br/></p><p>Look, let’s face it, Bill W and Dr. Bob weren’t the sort of people we’d want in AA now are they? </p><p>To respond to another point: the reason I don’t post my surname is because it is hard to be as vicious and bullying and to get away with my rants against (pretty much) all of AA, if I had to take responsibility for my actions. Newspapers and normal unanonymous websites have to tell 80% the truth, and 20% exaggerations and lies, otherwise they get legal trouble, or are in danger of being attacked in return. Because I am anonymous, I can tell 80% lies and exaggerations and 20% truth and no one can do anything! It saves me a lot of courage I can tell you!</p><p>Just because I’m a coward doesn’t mean I’m wrong. Just because I lie doesn’t mean I’m dishonest. And just because I don’t like the Big Book doesn’t mean I’m not a good, no great, A.A.. I am the savior of A.A.

Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always! Help to show the same love, service and tolerance I would hope for from others, and to be a channel for thy peace. Help me to humiliate and vilify those who defy you and myself, show me new ways to upset them and cause them despair. Direct my thinking towards sustained attacks and control, publishing any gossip and vicious rumour that extends my mission, and causes maximum pain and suffering. Help me to see that the ends justifies the means, and to remember it is fine to be a verbally violent and privacy invading thug. For in the end, the means are justified. Show me the way of love, tolerance, patience and kindliness, but let me remember our crusade is righteous God, so the sobriety and lives of those I must destroy are secondary to the light, the truth and the way!

<p>THE &ldquo;WORTH&rdquo; OF SOBRIETY</p>

<p>Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</p>

<p>— TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 160</p>

<p>When I go shopping I look at the prices and if I need what I see, I buy it and pay. Now that I am supposed to be in rehabilitation, I have to straighten out my life. When I go to a meeting, I take a coffee with sugar and milk, sometimes more than one. But at the collection time, I am either too busy to take money out of my purse, or I do not have enough, but I am there because I need this meeting. I heard someone suggest dropping the price of a beer into the basket, and I thought, that&rsquo;s too much! I almost never give one dollar. Like many others, I rely on the more generous members to finance the Fellowship. I forget that it takes money to rent the meeting room, buy my milk, sugar and cups. I will pay, without hesitation, ninety cents for a cup of coffee at a restaurant after the meeting; I always have money for that. So, how much is my sobriety and my inner peace worth?</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

I think a mind closes when it feels threatened. I certainly felt as though my private relationship with my Higher Power was being infringed upon. </p><p>And now, once again on of desperation, my mind is opening back up. </p><p><b>pg. 27- “The minute I stopped arguing, I could begin to see and feel&hellip; I certainly have that belief now&hellip; I had only to stop fighting and practice the rest of AA’s program as enthusiastically as I could.” </b></p><p>What I wish this said and maybe further on in the reading it does is that I can argue with <i>myself</i> about God. More than with anyone else- I argue over whether or not I’m going to pray, read my book, meditate on life’s lessons, and I argue about it with myself. </p><p>I’ve seen the miracles which come from working the program. I see them in the slow mental frameworks which direct my life. My life is better today with a clear head- clear of alcohol, pot, and even cutting, because that becomes an obsession, too- addicted to the chemicals my brain releases in response to such an action taken against myself. So now, clear-headed, it’s easier to catch myself when I’m slipping and take preventative measures. </p><p>So its not about believing anymore, but about putting in an effort to maintain conscious contact with my Higher Power so I’ll continue believing. </p><p>I sometimes feel I’m practicing the Program halfheartedly, unwilling to relinquish my control for the way that works. But now, by sitting down each night to do this, I feel like I’m accomplishing something, like I’ve earned my seat in Alcoholics Anonymous. </p><p><b>- “&hellip;AA’s tread innumerable paths in their quest for faith&hellip; you’ll be sure to discover one that suits if only you look and listen.” </b></p><p>I like that it says, “in your quest” because that’s what my experience is in AA. I’m on a quest to find what works, and so far AA’s taught me a lot. I’ve heard many approaches to faith, and several I find to be genuinely neat, but I have yet to find one I’ve stuck to. Instead of taking it as a lack of discipline on my part, I’ve just realized that the approach did not fit me. </p><p>I think and I hope I stick with this approach I’ve used for the past 2 days now. I have fear over what happens when winter comes and its too cold to do this [sit outside,] but maybe by then a solution will present itself. Whatever happens, all I need to do is take care of today. </p>"

Actually, to be honest, once I’ve managed to wipe out the whole idea of sponsorship from AA, it’ll be a little less stressful for me: I’m pretty busy cutting down people who do a lot of sponsoring, and it doesn’t give me much time to sponsor others! </p><p>Back to my point.

When I really look at my last year of drinking before the big bottom and leading up to it, I see that I didn’t escape the loss of self-sufficiency. I got to where I couldn’t go to school, or stay out of the psych ward, or do anything myself. I was at a complete loss of how to pull myself out of fear that I clung in on others’ personal time and space, and drowned myself in booze so thoroughly I just wanted to stay drunk, and when I couldn’t I would fantasize myself back into a drink. I so lacked self-sufficiency that my body started rebelling against me- I couldn’t even sleep without the aid of liquid NyQuil which has alcohol in it. </p><p><i>“&hellip;and all will to resist its demands.” </i><br/></p><p>When I wasn’t trying to quit and even most of the time when I was trying to quit, I was helpless to resist the effects of the drink. I wanted to be warm and fuzzy even as I wanted to be free of the helpless demoralization that befell me because I put it to my mouth. I saw all my “nevers” becoming every-day life and I was helpless to stop it. When my big bottom came, it hurt so bad I quit drinking, started smoking pot again, and developed a new habit- cutting. A few weeks, months, whatever went by and I was drunk again. I managed to tight fist my way through dry spells, but I was never truly what I’d call sober. </p><p><b>pg. 24- “Why all this insistence that every AA must hit bottom first? The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the AA program unless they have hit bottom&hellip; We stand ready to do anything which will lift the merciless obsession.”</b></p><p><i>“few people will sincerely try to practice the AA program unless they have hit bottom.”</i><br/></p><p>I hit the one bottom in November 2011. The last bottom at a poet party where I spilled my<i> biggest</i> secret and embarrassed myself in front of my new friends.- January 2013? April 12th, 2013 I realized I still wasn’t sober between pot and NyQuil. 4/13/13 is my sobriety date and I understand what the old-timers of AA mean when they say it’s harder to <i>stay</i> sober than it is to <i>get</i> sober. The longer I’m sober, the easier it is to <i>forget</i> that <i>absolute</i> feeling and state of demoralization that alcohol brought me to, and the easier it is to believe that <i>this</i> <i>time</i> I could conquer the demon alcohol and drink like a “normal” person. </p><p>I came into the AA program weighed down with guilt, hate (anger), and so much fear I was willing to try just <i>about</i> anything to escape its firm grasp upon my life. </p><p><i>“We stand ready to do anything which will lift the merciless obsession.”</i><br/></p><p>I tried poetry slams before AA. I am <i>terrified</i> of stages, public speaking, big crowds and praise. <i>BUT</i> I would climb on stage and perform. Eventually I started spending cab fare on wine and then stumble home afterwards in the dark and on my own. I was in the same hell, but at the time and even now I look at it as a “better” time. Goes to show just how rooted in denial we alcoholics can be. </p><p>Another aspect I deal with denial in is my <i>willingness</i>. I thought and still often catch myself thinking “how willing I am” to do as suggested. Yet in the beginning and even now sometimes, I get angry when someone suggest me to do service work, or asks me to read, or do coffee, or chips. I rebel in the terse shaking “no” of my head, or in the clip “not today” response. I avidly refuse to answer some suggestions about service work. I inwardly rebel when told to “pray about it.” I constantly take one or two steps forward only to leap back to the beginning. </p><p>So just how willing am I really? My willingness got me dry, but mostly I do not <i>feel</i> sober. Tonight I’m <i>starting</i> to, and that’s because I’m <i>actively</i> seeking out a new routine to connect to my Higher Power through this here “journal” and through the 12x12. </p><h2>It’s a start. </h2>"

I don’t remember setting up a reminder (and don’t remember getting one last year, though, I was still a drunk then, so who knows..) but it seems like something I’d do, so I’m being business casual about it.<br/></p>"

That the Loneliness I&rsquo;ve dread for so long was never going to go away by spending all my time with lonely people.

That my present and future would always be there waiting for me so running away was just a futile&hellip;

So now I&rsquo;m never lonely because I have myself. I was the only one that could get myself up and moving when my life was shit.

I&rsquo;ve grown as a man and have seen that I always had what it takes to face life head on. I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I see a bright n happy future ahead of me, but whatever is waiting for me tomorrow I sure as hell will wake up with a smile and keep moving forward

<p>(not that I&rsquo;m not close to/friends with a lot of y'all, but a lot of the people I talk to here I talk to on Facebook anyway)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think about changes like this very much, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve become less and less private - like I have a better idea of what kind of things I should share only with close friends or keep to myself completely and what kind of things I really shouldn&rsquo;t be withholding if I want to be genuine/open/honest</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but be thankful again for my sobriety. I&rsquo;m coming up on two years and, for me, I really believe that using was only ever getting in my way of having genuine, healthy relationships with others. I still sometimes wish I could be more like people who know when to stop before they&rsquo;re trashed, or people who don&rsquo;t mix and match to get more messed up, or people who could go the rest of their lives without doing x thing just because it isn&rsquo;t that important to them.</p>

<p>What matters most to me is that I continue to focus on my own personal growth so I can be the loving mother that I always wanted for myself for my daughter.</p>

<p>My hormones are settling down I think and I&rsquo;m relieved to not be angry over everything today.</p>"

They think it’s wallowing in self pity. They think that 3 months is more than enough time to have life bounce back to normal. This was my response after some initial confusion and anger:</p><p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, there is nothing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; about losing a parent. We only lose two in a lifetime, and that is if we are lucky enough to have two. Each person&rsquo;s journey is different, and it&rsquo;s invalidating to have people tell me that I am selfish, or that it&rsquo;s a good thing I didn&rsquo;t have to go through such and such.</p><p>Yes. I&rsquo;m grateful I had time with my mom before she passed away, and I&rsquo;m thankful to have been there for her sober. I do not have to carry the regret of being inebriated when she died, but the rest of it does not make it any easier for me to grieve.</p><p>This is about more than just losing someone I love. It&rsquo;s also about losing a part of my soul and transforming once again into that metaphorical butterfly. My mother was a huge part of my life for 27, almost 28 years. 3 months of grieving does not compare to the pain of loss I feel. I could get drunk and numb myself up.</p><p>OR, I can cry my bloody eyes out, scream at the wall, curl up in a ball and refuse to go any further for a day, get up and go to a meeting and share, share, share until I clam up in a corner. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather feel my way through it in whatever way comes to be, as long as I&rsquo;m not hurting anyone else, because that way is actually a lot less selfish than going out and getting hammered. All getting hammered ever did was cost myself, and everyone around me a whole lot of pain.</p><p>Yes, I expect there to be a point of healing, but that place starts right here where I am. Grieving.</p>"

Last Thursday I got into a cab, and another woman introduced herself. We were going the same place- the place I attend therapy at. For some reason she started giving me advice about alcohol even though I never mentioned my history with it. She recommended that I never drink and drive, and so then I told her that I was 2 years sober through the program. She was very happy to hear this, and even grabbed my hand. She shared with me some of her own personal history, and then also told me about some cool artsy stuff going on at the place I attend therapy at. When we parted ways, she asked me to tell my therapist hello for her, which I did.</p><p>Tonight I logged onto Facebook and found out that she&rsquo;s been charged with manslaughter for killing a little boy, and also hitting two members of his family. Unfortunately I do not know much more about it, because I only saw the pictures when I clicked on the link of the article. For some reason I was unable to see the article itself. From a comment I read, I gather that alcohol may have been a contributing factor.</p><p>It is sad to me that alcohol can damage so many lives- not only those who participate in it&rsquo;s consumption, but also in the lives of those who come into contact with those impaired by it. Prayers sent for all those involved in this tragedy.</p><p>Sometimes it is hard to understand the meaning of something happening. Sometimes the meaning becomes clear later on. Other times one is left scratching their head. I will never understand why a child has to die, why this particular tragedy had to occur. At the time I couldn’t understand why the woman mentioned alcohol and drinking and driving to me. It’s still unclear to me if this tragedy happened before or after our conversation, but what is clear to me is that she may just have been the one I needed to hear from. </p><p>Since my mother’s death, I’ve romanticized the drink. I’ve thought of going out. I’ve thought, “just one.” I’ve thought, “It’ll be different this time.” I’ve thought of how I’ll only stick to this or that brand. I’ve thought about eating beforehand. I’ve thought about the drink and not giving a fuck, because who really cares if I get drunk now? Who? Sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I just want to drown my sorrows, and the fact that I haven’t done so many things while drunk (yet) makes it that much easier for me to think that it won’t happen to me. </p><p>But this&hellip; THIS is a good reminder of what can happen when I pick up a drink. So tonight I go to bed sober, at 1:36 a.m. the 15th&hellip; scratching my head at tragedy, thanking God for the reminders, and praying for everyone involved- from the driver charged with manslaughter, to the injured and grieving family, to the baby who was sent to the next world before he had much of a chance to live. “But for the Grace of God, there go I.” </p>"

I’d probably just take a vitamin B complex vitamin but I’m not a doctor soooo&hellip;?)</li><li>Limit intake of fats, lots of fruits and vegetables (but try to avoid acids), low fat proteins and some whole grains once your stomach can handle it (mine definitely cannot at this point)</li><li>Avoid caffeine (lol, though no, sorry.

It’s a small step, I know, but I’d like to think it’s progress of a sort. I come from a family of hard drinkers and smokers. The difference between the rest of my family and me? My dad is a hard drinker but a former smoker. My brother is a former drinker and current smoker. My mother, like my father, is a hard drinker but she’s always been a non-smoker. Me? I’m just the only hard drinker and smoker.</p><p>So why is what happened tonight significant? I thought about going out for a pint, I really did. “Just one,” I thought. “Just one pint.”<br/></p><p>It’s the old reason for drinking: </p><p>“Just one pint.”</p><p>Just.</p><p>One.</p><p>Pint.</p><p>It’s been my downfall on more than one occasion and I hate it. “One pint” becomes two, then three, and more than likely four, and before I know it I’ve dropped $40+ plus cab fare.</p><p>This is an issue for me, and has been an issue since University almost 20 years ago.  I had my 90 day chip, but I tossed it when I left AA in 1998. I didn’t want to give myself over to something that I didn’t believe in to save myself from something that I could control.</p><p>I have my lapses. I’m only human. The difference now is that I don’t beat myself up over it to the point of contemplating suicide any more. Now if there is a night when I do overindulge, or do pass my limit I mark it on my calendar and start my count all over again of days without surpassing my own self-imposed “safe” limits. This gets tougher in sports seasons where I know the players personally and get along with them, but it is still manageable.</p><p>Some people say I have a disease.</p><p>Some people say I have a condition that can only be cured by some higher power.</p><p>To those I say this: I have a demon to fight. It’s not an easy one. It won’t be a fight that I will ever win outright, I don’t think. I fight it night by night. Some nights I win, some nights the demon does.</p><p>Some days when I don’t drink I wake up feeling like I did.</p><p>Some days when I do over-indulge I wake up feeling fine.</p><p>It’s not something I understand, but it is something I know I have to deal with on my own.</p><p>I AM strong enough.</p><p>I AM powerful enough.</p><p>If I need help, I will seek it out.</p><p>Thank you for listening.</p>"

<p>Either the A.A. way of life becomes one of joy or I return to the darkness and despair of alcoholism. Joy comes to me when my attitude concerning God and humility turns to one of desire rather than of burden. The darkness in my life changes to radiant light when I arrive at the realization that being truthful and honest in dealing with my inventory results in my life being filled with serenity, freedom, and joy. Trust in my Higher Power deepens, and the flush of gratitude spreads through my being. I am convinced that being humble is being truthful and honest in dealing with myself and God. It is then that humility is something I &ldquo;really want,&rdquo; rather than being &ldquo;something I must have.&rdquo;</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

<p>TOWARD PEACE AND SERENITY</p>

<p>&hellip; when we have taken a square look at some of these defects, have discussed them with another, and have become willing to have them removed, our thinking about humility commences to have a wider meaning.</p>

<p>— TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 74</p>

<p>When situations arise which destroy my serenity, pain often motivates me to ask God for clarity in seeing my part in the situation. Admitting my powerlessness, I humbly pray for acceptance. I try to see how my character defects contributed to the situation. Could I have been more patient? Was I intolerant? Did I insist on having my own way? Was I afraid? As my defects are revealed, I put selfreliance aside and humbly ask God to remove my shortcomings. The situation may not change, but as I practice exercising humility, I enjoy the peace and serenity which are the natural benefits of placing my reliance in a power greater than myself.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

<p>When I finally asked God to remove those things blocking me from Him and the sunlight of the Spirit, I embarked on a journey more glorious than I ever imagined. I experienced a freedom from those characteristics that had me wrapped up in myself. Because of this humbling Step, I feel clean.</p>

<p>I am especially aware of this Step because I&rsquo;m now able to be useful to God and to my fellows. I know that He has granted me strength to do His bidding and has prepared me for anyone, and anything, that comes my way today. I am truly in His hands, and I give thanks for the joy that I can be useful today.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

It makes me sad because working with them is the highlight of my work day. And my day. I love them. I’m considering staying with the company but applying to a different hotel that is a lot nicer and has a really good reputation. Everyone at my hotel wants to work there. I figure if I apply and I get it, then I am supposed to be there. If I don’t, then I am supposed to be where I’m at. This place is incredibly difficult to get into and there is an opening for a front desk position. I kind of don’t want to take on too much though because I’m already training with Mary Kay and I have the tendency to constantly take on new things and become overwhelmed or not know how to juggle everything.

I never want to give myself too much credit considering I’ll always have this disease and I give the credit all to a god of my understanding. This time last year, I popped a handful of xanax, blacked out for twelve hours, came to and went and got a bottle of tequila with all the money I had (a jar full of coins), then found myself at a stranger’s fourth of july party, locked myself in a room, and attempted to slit my wrists until I bled out and died. Luckily, since I was so drunk, I did a really crappy job of trying to kill myself, but the intention was still there. I feel so different from last year. My heart and my mind were so dark. These past few days I’ve been really anxious, unhappy, and scared. I decided to start my own Mary Kay business and have been feeling overwhelmed since. I also got a gym membership since I felt fat from the seroquel. Of course getting in shape is a positive thing, but I could feel myself obsessing. Looking in the mirror and not feeling okay with what I saw. And I’m a pretty skinny girl to begin with, but I’ve been obsessing over my stomach. Then I realized I wasn’t enjoying anything anymore. Everything I’ve been doing this past week has felt like a chore. Then, last night when I was at the gym with a friend, I came to another realization as we were playing raquetball. We didn’t have any rules, just running around, bouncing the ball off of the walls, almost smacking each other in the face with the rackets, and laughing our asses off. I was having so much fun and I noticed how much I was taking myself too damn seriously. Not enjoying anything I was doing. I’ve been keeping my thoughts pent up in my head too and after the workout, I talked to my friend in the sauna about what I’ve been going through. Now I’m trying to have fun with starting Mary Kay, fun with exercise, and with my life. I slept a lot more peacefully than I had been and I woke up more energized than I had the past few days. </p>"

Hangovers, for instance, are a negative consequence of drinking too much. </p><p><b>Abstinence:</b> Not using at all. All people start off abstinent. People can also return to abstinence after a period of experimentation or using. People who unknowingly ingest substances are also considered “abstinent” if they did not willingly take said substance. </p><p><b>Experimentation:</b> Becoming curious to use to see what a substance does/feels like. At this stage, substance is usually not sought after but provided either by friends or family. Negative consequences usually do not occur at this stage. <br/><br/><b>Recreational or social use:</b> At this stage, one is seeking out a substance to experience a desired effect, however, use is irregular and <b>has no established pattern</b>. Negative consequences usually do not occur at this stage. (Most people would consider themselves “recreational users,” but if there is <b>any</b> type of pattern to your use, you <i>usually</i> do not fall under this category!)</p><p><b>Habitual use:</b> At this stage, a definite pattern of use has evolved (daily, every other day, every weekend, etc.) and a stronger craving for the drug is developed. Negative consequences at this stage may not occur, but is more likely. </p><p><b>Abuse:</b> Habitual use becomes abuse when negative consequences occur and yet use still continues. For example, if you are drinking alcohol every weekend and experience hangovers each time, you may fall under this category. </p><p><b>Addiction:</b> Abuse becomes addiction when there is an apparent compulsion to use. At this point, tolerance has developed (needing to take more of the drug in order to experience the same desire effect), withdrawal symptoms are present, attempts to moderate use or stop completely are ineffective, negative consequences are occurring, the drug has become a priority, anxiety is present when the substance is not available, and the substance is often needed to function (whether emotionally, physically, or other). </p><p><b>“But I’m a functioning addict?” </b></p><p>Congratulations, you’re in denial. </p>"

<p>Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times.</p>

<p>Some say that experience is the best teacher, but I believe that experience is the only teacher. I have been able to learn of God&rsquo;s love for me only by the experience of my dependence on that love. At first I could not be sure of His direction in my life, but now I see that if I am to be bold enough to ask for His guidance, I must act as if He has provided it.

Drinking was my life, and now I&rsquo;m missing a part of me. I can&rsquo;t fill it with cigarettes, sex, caffeine, or love. It&rsquo;s a gaping black hole that&rsquo;s devouring every inch of me. I can only hope that once I&rsquo;m gone, something better will come out. Been trying to keep busy with hobbies and friends, but I can&rsquo;t outrun what&rsquo;s inside of me. I&rsquo;m a fighter, so if course I&rsquo;m going to go down kicking and screaming. I wish letting go was easier. We do what we can.

  // and the hard part is allowing pain to be felt, is accepting that people are sad and confused and they do stupid things because they’re wrapped up in themselves and not because they’re out to get me or see me suffer. It’s not my fault that people were cruel to me before I’d grown up, it’s not my responsibility to protect those I love from their own growth and their own learning process. I had the privilege of a time where I loved more strongly than I ever thought I’d be capable, and that’s what I take with me now. Knowing that I have the capacity for love, instead of telling myself that no one can be trusted and that I don’t deserve to be acknowledged, much less liked. I think we all have a time when we really realise that we aren’t happy with ourselves, that we’re living without honesty and authenticity, in favour of succumbing to our ego or our selfishness. And hopefully there follows from this a quiet and liberating acceptance that we can fiercely love ourselves, and nurture that love until it’s strong enough to radiate without being threatened.<br/>
  I’m still terrified of being vulnerable, but I’m learning that the lengths I go to in order to ensure I stay safe are nothing more than a waste of my energy. I can’t predict every outcome for every situation and save everyone at once. I wish I could, but I’m trying to unlearn the notion that I must protect everyone at all times and if I fail it’s because I’m useless. I don’t really know where I’m going with this (text post or with my life). But I do know that I need to keep checking up on myself, I hope I gently encourage those around me to do the same. I don’t know, and that doesn’t have to be a terrifying thing to say.</p>"

<p>A RIPPLING EFFECT</p>

<p>Having learned to live so happily, we’d show everyone else how… . Yes, we of A.A. did dream those dreams. How natural that was, since most alcoholics are bankrupt idealists… . So why shouldn’t we share our way of life with everyone?</p>

<p>— TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 156</p>

<p>The great discovery of sobriety led me to feel the need to spread the “good news” to the world around me. The grandiose thoughts of my drinking days returned. Later, I learned that concentrating on my own recovery was a full-time process. As I became a sober citizen in this world, I observed a rippling effect which, without any conscious effort on my part, reached any “related facility or outside enterprise,” without diverting me from my primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

<p>THE DETERMINATION OF OUR FOUNDERS</p>

<p>A year and six months later these three had succeeded with seven more.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the fierce determination of our founders, A.A. would have quickly faded like so many other so-called good causes. I look at the hundreds of meetings weekly in the city where I live and I know A.A. is available twenty-four hours a day. If I had had to hang on with nothing but hope and a desire not to drink, experiencing rejection wherever I went, I would have sought the easier, softer way and returned to my previous way of life.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

<p>For most normal folks, drinking means conviviality, companionship and colorful imagination. It means release from care, boredom and worry. It is joyous intimacy with friends and a feeling that life is good.</p>

<p>— ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 151</p>

<p>The longer I chased these elusive feelings with alcohol, the more out of reach they were. However, by applying this passage to my sobriety, I found that it described the magnificent new life made available to me by the A.A. program. &ldquo;It&rdquo; truly does &ldquo;get better&rdquo; one day at a time. The warmth, the love and the joy so simply expressed in these words grow in breadth and depth each time I read it. Sobriety is a gift that grows with time.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

I’m proud to say the running group has been a big hit.  And since it’s inception, I’ve lead a group run pretty much every Sunday.  It’s even created a bit of a buzz throughout the community and I now have a lot of recovering alcoholics and addicts approaching me at meetings and on the web to get more info.  It’s been hugely rewarding and I am so glad that I ACTED on an idea I had.  I was scared to at first, but once I saw how much interest there was, I felt compelled to move forward.  </p><p>Anyways, my Sundays have now become AWESOME.  I go to work for a few hours in the morning, then head to the meeting spot in the afternoon, lead the group through 3-5 miles, and then we high-five and take our endorphin-pumped selves out for snacks and refreshments.  And then I go to the big meeting I love so much in BK, and by the time I get back to Jersey City, I am exhausted but happy.  I have changed my Sundays completely.  That’s an example of a true behavioral reframe, and I am so grateful for that.  I only wish I had started it sooner&hellip;but isn’t that what everyone says whenever they put an idea they’ve had into motion?  </p><p>Through the running group, I’ve also met a lot more people, and thus my sober network has expanded tenfold.  I’m very grateful for this, too, because I don’t always find it easy to just strike up a conversation with a newcomer or other sober person, as recommended by the program.  But through this channel, I have a purpose, and I’ve found it very easy to talk to others about it.  This follows my own personal guidelines for trying to lead an open and fearless life.  It’s not always easy, but day-by-day, with practice, I am becoming better at it.  </p><p>One day at a time.</p>"

The subject in a sense embodies untruth when they become an addict. From then on the body and the self can no longer be lived as authentically mine. ‘Self-concealment is equal to leaving one’s body and the surrounding world to others in a self-chosen manner’ (van den Berg, 1972, p. 114). This leads to ever increasing alienation of addicts from those around them. It leads to being profoundly lonely. Van den Berg argues that loneliness is at the heart of all modern psychiatric illnesses: </p>

<p>The psychiatric patient is alone. He has few relationships or perhaps no relationships at all. He lives in isolation. He feels lonely. &hellip; Loneliness is the central core of his illness, no matter what his illness may be &hellip; If loneliness did not exist, we could reasonably assume that psychiatric illnesses could not occur either. (1972, p. 105)</p>

<p><br/>
 Addiction can therefore be understood as a thoroughly modern malady, perhaps the quintessential dis-ease of our times. That is perhaps why it claims millions in the Western world. Every Western country faces the challenge of addiction and the ways in which addiction is manifest is growing. Drug addiction is the supreme example, so is alcohol abuse, but now there is also gambling, shopping, sex, eating and other addictions.</p>","<p>Ryan Kemp <br/></p><p>Relating to the other: truth and untruth in addiction</p>"

Of that, I am certain.</p><figure class=""tmblr-full"" data-orig-height=""300"" data-orig-width=""300""><img src=""http://40.media.tumblr.com/b022b614d5b0ce87be613afaa429c590/tumblr_inline_nq49dxe5i31s7glz8_540.jpg"" data-orig-height=""300"" data-orig-width=""300""/></figure>"

<p>I just left a big women&rsquo;s meeting with a friend I&rsquo;ve had since I was counting days.  She&rsquo;s become one of my closest friends nearly two years later and that&rsquo;s an amazing feeling.  We are very much alike and yet very different and though she is younger than me, she has more sober time, and so I often lean on her.  I value our relationship very much.  </p>

<p>I am at a point where I feel a bit disconnected from the program.  I love AA and my network is pretty huge, but I find that I&rsquo;m not really as excited about meetings as I often am.  I&rsquo;ve been in this place before and I know it will cycle back around.  Of this, I have evidence.  </p>

<p>Last night was a blast.  It was S&rsquo;s fathers birthday and we all (meaning S, his sister, her husband, his mom, and myself) on their terrace joking around and telling stories for hours.  S and I had a really beautiful conversation beforehand and as predicted, are even more solid than before.  It&rsquo;s such a joy to know that we are both very much committed to this relationship.  He&rsquo;s really my person, and I&rsquo;m his.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling the easy breeziness of summer and want to live in this place forever.  The past semester was beyond challenging and though I learned so much and grew exponentially as a person, I am very happy to be on the other side of that intensity.  I need a break.  I also, however, need to find a new job: one that pays more and is in the field.  But right now, my motivation is nil.  I want to hang out with friends, drink coffee and juices, go to concerts, lounge on rooftops and in backyards, and just laugh.  I want to shop and put together fun outfits.  I want to write and I want to travel.  I want to read funny light books instead of peer-reviewed journal articles and I want to dance.  I want the lightness of being. And so I&rsquo;m trying to allow myself to relax into this place for a few more weeks.  I feel like I&rsquo;ve earned it.  </p>

I started another blog that I wrote in infrequently, and I found I really missed writing here.  Here, on this blog, is my journey&ndash; my historical record of my sobriety and here too do I feel most comfortable.  And so, I am back.  Without too much delving into the past few months, I&rsquo;ll just say that life has been very good.  It&rsquo;s definitely had its challenges and some down times, but overall, I am content.  I have almost two years of sobriety.  I am still in a very loving relationship.  I have great friends.  And I am almost done with grad school.  More about all of those things will come out in the days to come, but for now, here is my current state: </p>

<p>My heart aches and I feel vulnerable. My love and I got into a fight two nights ago and even though we made up very beautifully, I still feel raw.  This feeling is no doubt exacerbated by the fact that I got very little sleep last night despite being so tired.  So, today is just a groggy, vulnerable, gray Monday.  </p>

<p>I am always working on something within myself (that&rsquo;s a part of this process after all) and one of the things I am constantly trying to remain cognizant of is my catastrophic black and white thinking.  I&rsquo;m an alcoholic and I am prone to all or nothingness.  Such as, &ldquo;Oh, we got into a fight.  This is it.  Now we are going to break up.&rdquo;  This is definitely not the case though, of course, and in fact our spat brought us closer and to a deeper level of understanding, I think, but it&rsquo;s challenging for me to convince my brain that not every little spat means The End.  He even said to me when we made up that he never thinks about us not being together.  His brain doesn&rsquo;t traipse into that realm like mine does.  He always knows that we (and our relationship) are going to be OK.  What a beautiful place that must be to inhabit!  It no doubt made me feel much better to hear him say that, but I need to try to start occupying that space as well.  I think our fight was just a traumatic shock to my system because we don&rsquo;t fight much at all.  I hate it, and it scares me.  That fact doesn&rsquo;t prevent me from being real and speaking up if something is bothering me though.  I am not very adept at keeping my feelings hidden, and I suppose that&rsquo;s a good thing. </p>

<p>Anyways, the act of moderating ones thoughts when one is prone to worst-case-scenario thinking takes work.  And that sort of mental work wears me out.  But I know that with time, like anything else, this muscle will become strengthened and the routine- easier.  </p>

<p>Today I am going to be gentle with myself.</p>"

I’m not sure if it’s the meds or if I’m in the upswing of my moods but I don’t really care because I’m enjoying it. I’ve been a lot nicer to people at work and I’m realizing what a big difference that makes not only in the response I receive from people, but also how I feel about my job and myself. Seems like a no brainer huh? Not for this alcoholic, unfortunately. I accidentally logged into my old tumblr account from about a year ago when I was still drinking and using and I started reading my old posts. It felt like I was reading the diary of a stranger. A very sick, addicted stranger. It’s strange how quickly I forgot how utterly helpless I was before recovery. Most of the posts were drunk logs or about how depressed I was and how much I wanted to kill myself. I know that I still have my ups and downs now but the difference is that I no longer accept being a slave to my feelings. Now when I feel suicidal thoughts, I try to get help. I was put on seroquel last Tuesday and I do feel better, though I’m not sure if it’s my natural mood swings or if they are actually working this quickly. I’ve been getting slightly better sleep which helps, though the meds aren’t knocking me out as well as they were on Tuesday and Wednesday night. It’s amazing to me how much better I feel though since last year. </p>"

I feel truly blessed to be alive and to be healing mentally, physically and spiritually in my recovery. At first it was very difficult to live at all. I was sleeping for 12 -14 hours sometimes just to let my body recover. I look back at all the time I spent drinking and I was really living in an unhealthy way. I thought that I wasn’t an alcoholic before coming to AA but I discovered shortly after finding a good local meeting that I was in fact suffering from a serious disease. This disease made my life unmanageable at a certain point and I had no other choice but to give it up. <br/><br/>Sober life is the life for me. I have been getting back to reading and meditation daily. I have actually packed on a decent amount of wait because instead of wanting to drink all day now I want to eat all day. But soon I will start working out and I will get myself back into even better shape than I was in before. <br/><br/>I am working on getting a job right now so I can start really building my bank account and pay off the last of a few debts. Once I have a decent credit score and a good chunk of cheese saved up, I will be thinking about getting a vehicle</p><p>Peace to all human beings. I believe in pure love and grace in all of nature. Everyone is perfect already but some just haven’t realized it yet. </p>"

<p>IMPATIENT? TRY LEVITATING</p>

<p>We reacted more strongly to frustrations than normal people.<br/>
— AS BILL SEES IT, p. 111</p>

<p>Impatience with other people is one of my principal failings. Following a slow car in a no-passing lane, or waiting in a restaurant for the check, drives me to distraction. Before I give God a chance to slow me down, I explode, and that&rsquo;s what I call being quicker than God. That repeated experience gave me an idea. I thought if I could look down on these events from God&rsquo;s point of view, I might better control my feelings and behavior. I tried it and when I encountered the next slow driver, I levitated and looked down on the other car and upon myself. I saw an elderly couple driving along, happily chatting about their grandchildren. They were followed by me — bug-eyed and red of face — who had no time schedule to meet anyway. I looked so silly that I dropped back into reality and slowed down. Seeing things from God&rsquo;s angle of vision can be very relaxing.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

Much like with this tumblr, I used the songs as a prompt. I will share these one at a time to allow for further insight into my life and as a way for me to track my growth as a writer. This is the eleventh piece. Enjoy!*<br/></p><p><b>&ldquo;Would you tell me I was wrong? Would you help me understand? Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am?&rdquo;</b></p><p>I recently read John Green&rsquo;s young adult novel, Looking for Alaska, for a final project in another class. The novel is separated into &ldquo;Before&rdquo; and &ldquo;After.&rdquo; The separations refer to the death of the lead female protagonist, Alaska. While I enjoyed the &ldquo;Before&rdquo; immensely, the &ldquo;After&rdquo; section made me uncomfortable. I still enjoyed it and could not stop reading (except for a few moments when I simply had to put the book down). I didn&rsquo;t understand as I was reading why I felt so uncomfortable. I made myself power through instead of trying to figure it out. Upon completing the book, I sat up (I had been reclined on my friend&rsquo;s bed). I felt happy to be finished, but despite being satisfied with the ending, I felt uneasy. Shortly thereafter I excused myself for the evening and bid my friends farewell. As I stepped out of the dorm, I turned on my iPod and this song started playing. That&rsquo;s when it hit me.</p><p>See, it wasn&rsquo;t the death of Alaska that was bothering me. It was her friends&rsquo; reactions. They tried to unravel the truth behind her death. They weren&rsquo;t sure if it was a suicide or an accident. They spent most of the latter half of the novel trying different theories and looking for more information. Alaska was drunk when she died. That was part of what was bothering me. As I cleaned my mother&rsquo;s apartment, I was traumatized by what I found. I found 15 giant recycling bags full of empty bottles and cans. I found half-finished bottles of beer on her desk and in the sink. </p><p>At the same time, everybody told me she had suffered a heart attack due to the fact that she had been prescribed too many pills for her depression and the health effects of her drinking. My uncle told me about how she called him and told him about her relapse in the summer, but vowed to get her life back together. My father told me about her plans to move into a different apartment with a roommate so that she could get back on her feet. The last time my mother and I spoke she had told me about recently finding a job that was perfect for her. When she was found, she had been ironing her clothes for work. She was all set to go. </p><p>But still I was left with questions. Why was she drinking? When had she last been drinking? Why hadn&rsquo;t she called or texted me recently? What really happened? The worst question of all was the one that nobody would ever say yes to (even if they knew the truth) and that I was told to leave alone: did she commit suicide? That&rsquo;s what bothered me about the book. The teenagers searched and searched for an answer that I was told to leave alone. </p><p>I heard this song again recently and that is when I had the idea for this final project. This song is about loss. It&rsquo;s about hurting someone and hurting oneself as a result. Aguilera sings about regretting walking away and wishing that she could see the person she hurt again and forgive them for everything. I know that I hurt my mother. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I was too young to say no to my dad and it doesn&rsquo;t matter that she was hurting me and could have &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; my life as my dad said. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that counselors told me I was brave or strong. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I hurt her when I moved out. I hurt her when I didn&rsquo;t call her or text her because I was wrapped up in my own life. And I wish I could apologize. </p><p>The lyrics I chose were all questions. I chose them for two reasons. First, and more obviously, they are questions that we ask after loss. We want to know what the person would say. We want to know that the person is still with us. We want to know that they believe we are doing the right thing. But more importantly, any death, but especially this kind of death, leaves the survivors with many questions. Many questions that can&rsquo;t be answered. </p><p>The song &ldquo;Hurt&rdquo; is another song that speaks to the perspective of both the alcoholic or deceased and the people in his/her life. While the perspective of the survivor is clear, the perspective of the deceased requires some digging to uncover. Aguilera sings about the person telling her how proud they were before she walked away. She also sings about blaming the person for everything she &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; The deceased, along with feeling abandoned and feeling like a victim, also felt similar feelings t the singer. They both wanted to feel worthy and to be forgiven. They both wanted to share something but couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p><b>Self-blame is a common occurrence for both the alcoholic and the children. Even though the alcoholic is quick to blame others, there is often an element of self-resentment and frustration that traps them. Children (particularly if a divorce occurs) can be unsure of what to think, which leads them to think of themselves as the problem. Taking it upon themselves to solve the problem and save the parent is painful and unproductive.</b><br/></p>"

This is the ninth piece. Enjoy!*<br/></b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I thought that I heard you laughing. I thought that I heard you sing. I think I thought I saw you try. But that was just a dream. Try, cry, why try. That was just a dream.”</b><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p>I grew up listening to this song. My mom and I would listen to it on the car ride home when we drove home after after-school. I loved it long before I could relate to it. And now I keep it with me. Even though it&rsquo;s about an unrequited obsession for someone else, I find that it relates to my feelings towards my mother both before and after her death.</p><p>I loved my mother unconditionally. It hurt me to watch her struggle. It hurt me to beg her to stop. It hurt me to watch her continue. But I held onto every bit of hope I saw. Even after she went to relapsed several times, even after she went to the hospital several times, even after she called me and told me that George Lopez was in a helicopter by our house trying to save her (a hallucination) I found little sparks that kept me going.</p><p>When I looked up the song, I learned that &quot;losing my religion&rdquo; refers to losing one&rsquo;s temper or civility or being at the end of one&rsquo;s rope. I&rsquo;m not sure about the first two, but I related to last one a bit. I often felt that I was at the end of a rope. But I managed to hold on over and over. More than that, losing my religion meant to me that I was losing parts of myself that were extremely important. Sometimes that meant that I was losing hope. Sometimes it meant that I was losing my ability to think clearly. Sometimes it simply meant that I was becoming lost. </p><p>But no matter how lost I became, I kept my eyes on my mother trying to protect her. At the end of her life, I knew that I was the only one she had left. She told me. But even if she hadn&rsquo;t I knew. I carried that with me to her funeral. When I saw my extended family (I hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone from either side in years) I was resentful. I was frustrated. It wasn&rsquo;t fair that they acted as if they had been there all along. When my dad rose and said that she had never been abandoned, I lost it. Inside of course. It was bullshit. I did everything I could to keep myself quiet. I couldn&rsquo;t even look at him. That&rsquo;s when I momentarily lost my religion.</p><p>Since her passing, I dreamt of my mother once. But it wasn&rsquo;t, as the song says, &ldquo;just a dream.&rdquo; I spoke to her. I told her about my life. When I felt myself waking up, I turned to her and said, &ldquo;I have to go now. I love you. I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo; My mother didn&rsquo;t believe in good-byes, at least not with me. She always believed in see you laters. That&rsquo;s a part of my religion now. And I&rsquo;m not going to lose it.</p>"

Jesus take the wheel, oh take it from me.&rdquo;</b><br/></p><p><b></b>These two songs speak to the time that my mother truly committed to AA. After seeing what her drinking had cost her, she realized that she didn&rsquo;t want to lose any more time. She had missed so many moments for years of my life. She had lost her job. She had spent all of her money and a large chunk of mine. She had finally hit rock bottom. She didn&rsquo;t want to waste her life anymore. She committed to AA for herself, and for me.When she found AA, she also found religion. She realized that she didn&rsquo;t have control of herself anymore and so she asked for someone else to take control. She let her faith and belief be her strength. She carried the serenity prayer with her everywhere she went. She carried her coin from 1 day of sobriety with her. Her sponsor got her a ring and she wore it. She knew that she could do it. For some time, she found the strength and the faith to get by.</p>"

The worst I’ve deleted , the constant bruises and alcohol all over my apartment. <br/>
These pictures show me ^^^ heavier and blitzed. There wasn’t a period longer than a day id go without some kind of drink (maybe two days), but then daily liquor and wine drinking begun and I was even more gone. <br/>
What I thought was good social drinking really was chaotic and harmful right from the start (circa 2004). </p>

<p>I was mean, selfish, a cheater to my friends and lovers, horrid to my family, I lost all sense of self by the end. Really, it was a progressive decline during the last 10 years. </p>

<p>I blamed everything. Anything not going my way in my life was an excuse to keep hurting myself. “Look at what a waste I am, why wouldn’t I drink, I have nothing going for me”<br/>
That was selfish thinking! I was doing nothing but wallow.</p>

<p>6 and a half months sober I have a clarity and awareness I haven’t had in - ever ?<br/>
When was I sober long enough to appreciate the true value of MY life and the lives around me. When was I sober enough to have real gratitude? When was I sober enough to be honest? </p>

<p>My life isn’t the way I want it to be, because I don’t know what that even means to me at the point but it’s fuxk tons better than it was. I haven’t begun to try to mend those past bridges I’ve burned , and learning through AA it’s not about “mending”, because others may not want to hear it. But it’s about “cleaning house”, clearing the wreckage of my past and my past and not being ashamed about it anymore.</p>

2015 started with a BANG - sober &amp; present.
This is a year of miracles for me, and I&rsquo;m doing everything I can daily to nourish my recovery. 
Cliché slogans help me persevere. 
&ldquo;One day at a time&rdquo; got me here.
Almost 25, being able to celebrate a year of life with my family who had no reason to let me back in their home. Who had no responsibility to care for my cats and bird while I was away."

<p>ENTIRELY READY?</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the Step that separates the men from the boys.&rdquo;&hellip; the difference between &ldquo;the boys and the men&rdquo; is the difference between striving for a self- determined objective and for the perfect objective which is of God&hellip; . It is suggested that we ought to become entirely willing to aim toward perfection&hellip; . The moment we say, &ldquo;No, never!&rdquo; our minds close against the grace of God&hellip; . This is the exact point at which we abandon limited objectives, and move toward God&rsquo;s will for us.<br/>
— TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 63, 68, 69</p>

<p>Am I entirely ready to have God remove these defects of character? Do I know at long last that I cannot save myself? I have come to believe that I cannot. If I am unable, if my best intentions go wrong, if my desires are selfishly motivated and if my knowledge and will are limited — then I am ready to embrace God&rsquo;s will for my life.</p>","AA Daily Reflections"

It felt like home. It felt cozy and I was happy I had the honour of introducing my friend (she had asked me to bring her. She wanted to know more about AA). There were 2 amazing speakers who shared stories. Everything I hear a speaker share there story I connect to at least one part of there story. I will relate to at least one similar circumstance I myself experience. </p><p>Its very beautiful that I am sober for two year (today is my anniversary yaya!)  And I went to a meeting with a friend who may decide to pick up a white chip. And I enjoyed the meeting and know I am for sure going back! </p><p>I know I just get so stuck on sponsors and calling. And to me I get overwhelmed. Well I haven’t been to a meeting in a year and I don’t want to wait another year to go to a meeting! So I’ll go and just stay away from the drama and politics. Everyone has their own recovery.</p>"
