""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

"jN9XrTcVdV0","Danny J. ""NA Speakers"" 12-Step ""Addiction Recovery""","Danny shares an awesome story of recovery at an NA speaker meeting! Thanks Danny! :) 

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

"_vSQA2rSEeU","Gina B. NA Speaker ""Drug Addiction Recovery"" 12-Step Recovery","""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G8MDRJSW8PX6S

Dr Paul O, gives us this is a hilarious yet highly poignant recorded live talk from many years ago now.
He, for a period became a patient in the mental health hospital that he was also on the staff of due to his personal challenges with Alcoholism.

This talk has provided me personally with many hours of enjoyment, and relief, through the rough times of life! Somehow when I listen to it, things brighten up, and I don't feel quite so alone with my own recovery in this vast world of ours and its people. 

""Doctor, Alcoholic, Addict"" as he puts it, Dr. Paul O. MD, not all that many know that Dr Paul O wrote one of the Stories in the Book known as ""Alcoholics Anonymous.""
It is a story he wrote about himself and his experience, and that particular story is on the subject of ""Acceptance,"" this talk he gives vocalises around that story.

The stories tend to change through the various editions of the book ""Alcoholics Anonymous,"" familiarly known to many in recovery as ""The Big Book"" [As it was Big] but the main text of the first 164 pages which is ""the message"" of Alcoholics Anonymous rarely changes at all.

The Big Book [Alcoholics Anonymous], is also the book that is shared with the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, and his sister groups such as Al-Anon, Narcotic Anonymous, and Cocaine Anonymous, which is where each of them also derive the ""12 Step program.""

So, without further elaboration let's hear straight from the man himself, sharing his Experience, Strength, and Hope! And a whole lot of humour!

Dr Paul O! Thanks so much.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

If you are questioning AA's effectiveness or if it works, please do yourself a favor and listen to this share by Ralph from California. It is so uplifting and incredible.  He has such a fluid and smooth style of speaking, it makes it incredibly easy to listen to.  This is one of the best AA speaker tapes out there!

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

Don does a GREAT job of telling his story and a mini-workshop on feelings in sobriety.

The grace of our Higher Power is not something we should put a damper on, or hide, because we are afraid someone will mock us or say something that might discount what we are saying.

Get ready for an awesome spiritual journey and some incredible insights! This workshop DELIVERS on ALL levels! 

The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.

Help IS out there!

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

He then goes on to talk about the second step, and how he ""Came to believe a Power Greater Than Himself could restore him to sanity."" AWESOME share on steps one and two! Enjoy! :)

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

"KQUFfSAoIuk","Chris S. ""Addiction, Alcoholism, and the Family"" - 12-Step Recovery Speaker","Another great talk from Chris S.!  This talk deals with the all-important aspect of alcoholism and addiction being a family disease.  It deals with how we relate to our families and how they relate to us.  GREAT tape with LOTS of useful tools and insights! 

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

In this AWESOME tape, Bob D. shares about why he is a grateful alcoholic in his simple, heart-felt, and insightful style.  Bob has such a gift at communicating and he is extremely good at relaying his introspection.  Gratitude is sometimes not the most favorite topic in AA to say the least, but this talk will definitely make you think in new ways about it.

He has an entertaining and engaging style and he is really hilarious as he details his adventures in his addiction and recovery!  This is a MUST LISTEN for anyone who is clean in a program or who wants to get clean but does not know how.  Thank you so much for a wonderful share Alan! 

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

This workshop features two of the all-time best AA speakers, Mark H. from Texas and Joe H. from California.  They really go in to the depth and weight of the program and it is a VERY moving workshop.  One of my favorite parts is when they get to the 11th step and Mark and Joe share in the most detail I have ever heard them share regarding their spiritual experiences.  Joe H. tells his FULL story about his travels to India and it is absolutely amazing.  Prepare to be disturbed, to laugh, to cry, and most importantly, have a new experience in your own recovery. :)

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

"3DPJ0-X2XHE","Shawn H. Cocaine Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-02-07T23:47:18.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","9","7818","0","4","130"

"mCMHgWHdeI0","Earl H. - AA Speaker - ""Growing in the Steps and Sobriety""","One of my favorite AA speakers, Earl H. takes on the topic of how to grow in sobriety.  In this talk, he really goes in to depth about Steps 10, 11, and 12.  While sometimes referred to as the ""maintenance steps"" Earl shatters that falsehood and talks about the immense amount of growth and the rich experiences he has had in these steps.  

As usual, Earl is on fire with his hilarious sense of humor and his sharp wit.  This is a very insightful and provocative talk! Highly recommended and very entertaining!

From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-03-02T14:25:56.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message', u'Cocaine (Abused Substance)']","5","5459","0","1","68"

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-03-17T20:34:57.000Z","[u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'AA', u'AA Speaker', u'Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker', u'AA Big Book', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Services', u'aa.org', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Convention', u'Twelve Steps and Twelve traditions', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'xa speakers', u'Bill W', u'Bill Wilson', u'xa', u'wedorecover12', u'we do recover 12', u'carry the message']","0","352","0","1","1"

CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-02-09T22:40:55.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","4","3075","0","3","53"

From Wikipedia: James Patrick Kinnon (5 April 1911 - 9 July 1985), commonly known as Jimmy Kinnon or ""Jimmy K."", was the primary founder of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering addicts. During his lifetime, he was usually referred to as ""Jimmy K."" due to NA's principle of personal anonymity on the public level. He never referred to himself as the founder of NA, although the record clearly shows that he played a founding role.
When Kinnon was seven years old he befriended a local alcoholic who he referred to as Mr. Crookshank. He would often find him drunk and beaten. One day Kinnon found him badly beaten up and unresponsive. Kinnon ran for help. Over the following weeks Kinnon did not see Crookshank and after numerous inquiries his mother took him to see his friend. They went to an institution that Crookshank was now a resident of. He was wheelchair-bound and incoherent. Upon leaving the facility Kinnon told his mother that when he grew up he was going to help people like Mr. Crookshank.
Kinnon was born in Paisley, Scotland on April 5, 1911. He and his parents moved to the United States in the 1920s. For medical reasons he was separated from his parents on Ellis Island for three and a half days. He befriended a Russian family while he was waiting for his sister to be cleared of a medical issue. When the family was reunited they moved to Philadelphia. He never saw the Russian family again. While in Philadelphia Kinnon went to private school and had plans of entering the priesthood. He began using alcohol and drugs which started getting him in trouble. He never followed through with his goal of becoming a priest.
Kinnon stopped using drugs and alcohol on February 2, 1950. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous, a twelve-step program. While in Alcoholics Anonymous he met other members who had struggled with addiction to substances other than alcohol. Alcoholics Anonymous often discouraged members from talking about addictions other than alcohol. Kinnon attended meetings of another group called Habit-forming Drugs but was disappointed with them.
In the summer of 1953 Jimmy Kinnon and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous began holding their own separate meetings, which they called Narcotics Anonymous. Mr. Kinnon and several others were given permission from Alcoholics Anonymous to adapt the AA Twelve Steps, but Jimmy changed the Step 1 from ""Powerless over Alcohol"" to ""Powerless over Addiction."" This a significant change of focus from the AA program because NA is focused on the recovery from the disease of addiction rather than any particular substance that was used. Mr. Kinnon saw that the substance being a symptom of a deeper core issue, (i.e. the thinking, obsession and compulsions) which the substance is used to gain a temporary relief from. Narcotics Anonymous was officially founded in July 1953 in Sun Valley, California. There was a different organization also called Narcotics Anonymous that was previously founded by a recovering addict named Mr. Danny Carlsen in New York City, but it did not follow the 12 Traditions and was more of a social-services organization rather than a Fellowship. It died out in the mid-1960s and was never connected to the NA Mr. Kinnon started in Sun Valley that remains and flourishes all over the world today.
Most of Narcotics Anonymous early literature was written by James Kinnon and is still used worldwide today in over 62,800 NA meetings. He was the main contributor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White booklet that were used throughout the 1960s and 1970s. From 1953 to 1977 Narcotics Anonymous was a safe haven for addicts to meet in their NA meetings, to help each other get and stay clean from all substances, including alcohol, which in truth is a drug. From 1979-1982 hundreds of Narcotics Anonymous members expanded on this literature and created the Basic Text. Mr. Kinnon also designed the NA logo, The Group Logo, The Service Symbol and wrote the Gratitude Prayer and ""Fruit of the Harvest"" statement found in the beginning of the NA book ""The Basic Text"". This book was the first ever known that was written by recovering addicts for recovering addicts. It was first published in 1982.
James Kinnon died of lung cancer on July 9, 1985 in California. Prior to his death he said, if he ever had a headstone it would read, ""All we did was sow some seeds and work and wrought to make this work, so that we and others could live. In Peace, in Freedom and in Love. He was clean for thirty five years at the time of his death.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-07-07T02:28:40.000Z","[u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Narcotics Anonymous Founder', u'Jimmy Kinnon', u'Jimmy K', u'Who started Narcotics Anonymous', u'NA', u'NA Basic Text', u'Addiction Treatment', u'12 step program', u'History of NA', u'History of Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Big Book of AA', u'Who founded narcotics anonymous', u'who founded NA', u'Wedorecover12', u'we do recover', u'addiction', u'recovery', u'xa', u'xa speaker', u'Narcotics anonymous speaker', u'NA Speaker', u'NA Founder', u'Drug', u'Addict', u'Jimmy', u'Kinnon', u'Narcotics', u'Anonymous']","28","44394","0","17","400"

Hence, treatment is focused toward dismantling the previous identification; upon which the goal of remission of addictive behaviors follows quite organically.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-03-05T23:32:32.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","6","2824","0","1","43"

Very inspirational story and a testament to how the program of Narcotics Anonymous can change an addict's life and propel them to serenity and fulfillment.  A big thank you to his nephew Pete, for making this awesome talk available!

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed.

How am I feeling, why and what to do, means we can be assertive in expressing how we feel. ""How are we feeling?"" Offers the opportunity to be assertive with each other and have empathy or least try to develop empathy in any situation in life...

What about fear and anxiety? Often when we are fearful there is a good reason, something is happening now, which triggers our emotions and is obvious. What is less obvious, can be a profound recollection. Often we might find ourselves caught in a lie when we are trying to be agreeable, and find common ground and then suddenly we feel caught out. That sensation when the lie is discovered... Anger at ourselves and resentment; followed by cover up in some way. Why did I do that!?

"aZnSykr7TgA","Psychotherapy's role in mutual aid based recovery from addiction and alcoholism -- Noel Mcd","In the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous, the most well known of the mutual aid programs for addiction recovery, the views of Dr Freud and CG Jung were sought on the predicament of the alcoholic and the prognosis if utilising psychoanalytic or analytic psychology approaches.

Dr Freud apparently told the founders of AA that his method could not help the chronic alcoholic. Mr Jung in letters to one of the founders Bill W, suggested the alcoholic needed the help of a 'wall of humanity' to sustain abstinence from alcoholic dependence and thereby death or incurable brain disease.

Hence was born the notion of 'fellowship' or as we call it professionally, mutual aid. Inside the wall of humanity the recovering alcoholic-addict rebuilds their sense of self to engage with the world again.

How can we as psychotherapists engage with this process? This was the substance of the conversation with Noel McDermott. A psychotherapist who specialises in facilitating addicts into mutual aid programs.

Noel explored some of the evidence base for mutual aid, present his work in the main form of mutual aid '12 Step' (AA. NA. CoDA. Al-Anon. Al-Ateen. SLAA. OA. GA. UA etc). Looking at the dynamics of the steps, how they interface into psychotherapeutic practice.

Noel McDermott

Noel has worked in health, child and social care since the mid 1980's. Initially as a community worker in Birmingham's area of Handsworth, developing a deep attachment to diversity that is characteristic of his approach to life.

After University as an undergraduate he pursued a love of theatre and the arts. Working as a community arts worker. Noel took his arts background into his training as a specialist psychotherapist (dramatherapy) qualifying as a post-graduate in 1996. Post qualification he achieved and maintained statutory registration and currently is licensed to practice with the Health and Care Professions Council. He moved to Scotland working in adult community mental health, psychiatric in-patient, forensic and social services settings.

On return to London he worked in social services settings; managing services to refugees, children, families and adults across all service areas. Then he moved into the third sector working with trauma, children and their families, adult mental health, addictions.

Over time he has integrated CBT, solution focused and brief approaches, family work and recovery based practices to his original psychodynamic training. He is a pragmatist. He is currently interested in ongoing research from neurosciences as well as uses of Web 2.0 and online spaces.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Khalis from Harlem, New York shares a powerful story of recovery and his redemption from drug addiction!

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America. In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries. In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings. In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings. In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings. In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings. In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

"OsEA5Duu18g","Rick W. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-12-12T00:59:54.000Z","[u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Sexaholics Anonymous', u'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous', u'Gamblers Anonymous', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'Marijuana Anonymous', u'Celebrate Recovery', u'Higher Power', u'God', u'Addiction', u'Recovery', u'12 Step Recovery', u'Speaker', u'NA', u'AA', u'CA', u'OA', u'GA', u'12 step program', u'12 steps', u'Methamphetamine', u'Opiates', u'Marijuana', u'Heroin', u'Survivors', u'Alcoholism', u'Big Book', u'Basic Text', u'12 and 12', u'It works how and why', u'Co-dependent', u'Al-Anon']","0","1966","0","2","17"

The references in The Big Book, The 12x12 and AA Comes of Age were likely made in loose regard to the 1913 autobiographical novel by the extremely popular American author Jack London that chronicled his struggles with alcoholism. The novel's title ""John Barleycorn"" was taken from the British folksong of the same name. In the song John Barleycorn represents the vital barley grain crop and the beer and/or whiskey made from it. In the song, John Barleycorn suffers pain, humiliation and death, in ways which are said to represent the growth, cutting and distilling of barley. Around the time of the writing of much of A.A.'s literature ""John Barleycorn"" had come to be used as a euphemism for alcoholism or alcohol. There are many different versions of the song and the content can vary considerably but generally have to do with themes of growth, suffering, death, alcohol, revenge... and barley.

Given the choice, would you play Russian roulette? With a clear head and a focus on reality, would you pick up a gun, with one bullet in one chamber and five empty and spin the chamber, point the gun at your head and fire? The odds favour the stupid and insane. And yet life is about risk, life is about courage, and life is about bravery. And life is about having fun. In our right mind. We wouldn't even consider Russian roulette. And yet everyone doubts the dangers apply to them when it comes to alcohol. The consequences of being out of control impact emotionally and physically. I worked hard and played hard over thirty-five years, alcohol a constant companion. And they say, whoever they are, and I've yet to meet them, ""nothing is wasted in God's economy."" Actually, I'm happy to say that nothing is wasted in God's economy, and I do not want to put the clock back, alcohol served its purpose in my life, at the same time, many people are not alive to tell the tale and only serve as dead examples of the consequences with alcohol...

One of the great things about this set of talks is that they go more in-depth about TONS of topics pertinent to recovery.  LINK to Part 2: http://youtu.be/3hr2-kzXUjA

This workshop by Polly is life-changing and extremely powerful!  It covers way too many topics to list here, but this is a MUST LISTEN for sure for anyone in recovery from alcoholism!

The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there!

His message is clear, filled with hope, and I can relate to so much of what he talks about in this tape!  He deals with adversity, challenges, and experiences the depths of a horrible addiction.  He learns that from weakness comes a sense of strength and serenity that changes him and catapults him to a fulfilling and wonderful life clean and in recovery.  GREAT stuff! :)

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

One fellowship, many faiths... From religious, to secular, to living in the moment of now and being able to cope. However we do it, thinking always leads back to control.

Trying to understand our mood in the moment of now is always the starting point when it comes to formal meditation for me. How am I feeling? Why and what to do next. Right now I feel good, so likely my thinking is good and my intentions and actions are likely to be good. Looking outwards, open honest and willing to be helpful as I am in life and part of society today...

One of the speakers yesterday mentioned that the fellowship of AA was their primary source in recovery. And over the years they had been to many different fellowships for different addictions to substance and behaviours. I must say I have attended other fellowships, and that the core of all fellowships are the twelve steps to live a life with freedom of choice. In my case, the fellowship of AA provides an answer to addiction relating to any substance and any behaviour around people places and things. One fellowship for everything. And yet I know, every fellowship has its place for those of any background needing particular help with particular addictions. One fellowship is no better nor worse than the other. My only advice, do one set of steps, and learn the principles, the principles work if we work them one day at a time...

The best advice, keep on listening, keep on relating and find like-minded individuals in recovery, who can help you for a day. Sponsors can help, and also sponsors can hinder. Sponsors in an ideal world can help you learn the steps and traditions in the fellowship. How we then live the principles, the twelve steps and see how the twelve traditions fit into the framework of our living will always be a unique experience for each individual. One fellowship, learning by experience, becoming stronger and more hopeful and so many ways to live sober as there are people in fellowship. Our good fortune is we learn what we can do and cannot do on a daily basis, we learn to cope with reality, we learn that love is always at the core of our existence...

Humility... Learning to ask for help from anyone anywhere about anything which impacts on anyone today. Asking for help, powers up the people around us, powering up the people around us to help us is a key to opening the doors to new living and new possibilities. Asking for help means we will have to sort, and sift as we often can be overwhelmed with suggestions and solutions. We still need to work at solutions and the power that works through people will only diminish if we are selfish and remain dormant. Humility, this impacts on our courage, faith and confidence to keep on taking another step, a new path, retracing our steps when needed, and learning what works in life one day at a time...

The last day of my regular daily reflections and the start of my sabbatical to explore interests and possibilities. Sharing experience, strength and hope openly since 2004, has taken many hours a day, writing and sharing and replying privately to many fellow travellers in recovery over the years. So many places to share and so many people sharing their wisdom openly wherever they feel able has helped me enormously in recovery. At the same time, where would I be without face-to-face contact, and the benefit of loving friends close? I would not be here without their help one day at a time. And face-to-face, recovery in the moment, with love at the core works in the ever present, imperfectly perfect moment of now... Treasured and cherished companion's trudging the road of destiny together with love always... May your God, may your good, may your good conscience be with you today and every day...","UCqOXCRK6RWdkMswq1AZQRDA","2011-12-18T15:42:13.000Z","[u'Step Twelve', u'AA 12 Steps', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'12 Steps AA', u'Addiction And Recovery', u'Addict', u'Alcoholic', u'Alcoholism', u'DonInLondon', u'Life Works']","9","332","0"

Let go anger one day at a time... Less fixing and more living in the moment, occasions happen where old feelings rise up in daily experiences. Letting go is recognising the impact of today's events, accepting we need change our responses rather than reacting in the same old ways. If I don't see it, you do, tell me today...

AA Daily Reflections ~ ""Step eight ""removing the ground glass..."": The moral inventory is a cool examination of the damages that occurred to us during life and a sincere effort to look at them in a true perspective. This has the effect of taking the ground glass out of us, the emotional substance that still cuts and inhibits. [as Bill sees it...]

My Eighth Step list used to drag me into a whirlpool of resentment. After four years of sobriety, I was blocked by denial connected with an on-going abusive relationship. The argument between fear and pride eased as the words of the Step moved from my head to my heart. For the first time in years I opened my box of paints and poured out an honest rage, an explosion of reds and blacks and yellows. As I looked at the drawing, tears of joy and relief flowed down my cheeks. In my disease, I had given up my art, a self-inflicted punishment far greater than any imposed from outside. In my recovery, I learned that the pain of my defects is the very substance God uses to cleanse my character and to set me free.""

Step 8 is the beginning of making amends, of healing the past with others. From the inventory of Step 4, I have a good starting place for making a list of people that I have harmed. I look over my personal inventory and possibly reflect on my life again. I make a list of the people that I have harmed. I can write down thoughts beside each name about what the appropriate amends might be. I then go through the list and make sure I am willing in my heart to make the amends.

Staying sober and helping each other, supporting, suggesting and never imposing beliefs or opinions on our fellows. Common ground, our desire to be sober one day at a time. And in fellowship respectful of all opinions and beliefs, everything to help each of us make free choices, based on reality as it is. And the possibilities we have today...

By the time I got to the fellowship of AA, I had lost my ability to live in reality and cope with it. I was very unwell. Physically and mentally exhausted and definitely at a rock bottom. Trying to cope with the physical withdrawal from alcohol was very disturbing. Trying to cope with the mental exhaustion was not only disturbing, I realised it was going to take quite a while to feel like any recovery was possible. Once I realised it was okay to be unwell, and then to start recovery, with a time frame of one day, and at one day is all that counts to anyone in recovery, I started to feel a lot better about trying to do the impossible, to stop drinking and simply cope with the consequences of drink and stopping the drinking. My sister, suggested I should start from scratch, as if I knew nothing. And then maybe I could listen to the experience, strength and hope of other people. Wise words from someone not afflicted, simply suggesting I give myself a break and understand that I needed time to recover enough to understand something about recovery. And the one day time frame has stuck for quite a number of years, right up to the present day, and hopefully all of today...

I was so confused in early days, but I was able to access the literature of the fellowship, the big book of AA, with all the stories of recovery, written by people over the years. And there was another book, the twelve steps and twelve traditions. And I started to read about the twelve steps which help a person become free once again. Or, for the first time in their lives, experiencing freedom of choice and not feeling controlled either by alcohol, people, places and things. And then the twelve traditions, understanding how the fellowship works. In unity, service and recovery. The twelve traditions, which hold the fellowship together, and ensure each and every one of us can keep hold of our own opinions and beliefs, and still function together on common ground. Ultimately being completely honest with ourselves and with the world in our endeavours. Anonymity, providing sanctuary to find this new path of recovery, and develop our emotional and spiritual experience of living in the moment of now...

"bXM5YpR0Gf4","Marijuana Maintenance: Cannabis for Alcohol Dependence","You might be saying to yourself, why do we need to use medical marijuana for alcohol dependence--can't we just send everybody to a 12 step program and make them quit completely? The answer to this is a simple no. Although 12 step programs are great for the people that they work for, the simple fact is that 12 step programs fail to help the majority of people with alcohol problems. According to the National Institute On Alcohol Abuse And Alcoholism, only one out of every fourteen people with an Alcohol Use Disorder will ever seek treatment for it. And according to Doctor Jeffrey Brandsma and others who have researched the effectiveness of treatment programs, over two thirds of people who enroll in 12 step treatment programs will drop out without finishing them. Twelve step programs are great for the people that they work for, but something else is needed for the majority of problem drinkers who are failed by them. Fortunately, medical marijuana can fill that need for many people suffering from alcohol use disorders.

Some people might view the use of medical marijuana to treat alcohol dependence as simply substituting one addiction for another. However, when we view things from a public health perspective, we find that there is a tremendous difference in the impact of alcohol dependence when compared to marijuana use. Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome is accompanied by seizures, hallucinations, tremors, irregular heartbeat, and spikes in blood pressure. Untreated severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome leads to death in one out of every three cases.

By way of contrast there is NO physical withdrawal from cannabis. People who are subject to alcohol withdrawal syndrome can benefit greatly by substituting medical marijuana for alcohol. The same is true for people who become violent or otherwise lose control of their behavior when drinking--pot might make you mellow but it won't make you violent. People who have suffered liver damage from alcohol abuse can also benefit from medical marijuana because cannabis is not toxic to the liver.

Some people might think that if you give medical marijuana to alcoholics they will both drink and smoke pot and have a double addiction. However, ALL of the research contradicts this assumption. In every single case where medical marijuana has been used as a treatment for alcoholism patients have reported either major reduction in alcohol consumption or complete abstinence from alcohol.

Doctor Tod Mikuriya has been prescribing medical marijuana for a number of conditions including alcoholism for many years. In 2004 he published his research on the use of medical marijuana to treat alcohol dependence. Doctor Mikuriya prescribed cannabis to 92 patients suffering from Alcohol Use Disorders. Every single one of these 92 patients reported a major reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems. Nine patients reported that they managed to abstain from alcohol completely for a year or longer. All attributed this to the effects of medical marijuana.

Research on Medical Marijuana published in 2009 by Amanda Reiman of the School of Social Welfare of the University of California, Berkeley gave similar results. Patients who were prescribed medical marijuana showed great reductions in their consumption of alcohol or other drugs as well as great reductions in drug or alcohol related harms

It all goes to show that the substitution of cannabis for alcohol or other drugs is one of the most successful harm reduction strategies ever invented.

Medical marijuana is now legal in 14 states. If nothing else works for your alcohol problem, then give medical cannabis a shot. The life you save may be your own.

Thank you.

"XdCkgJuAgdc","Myers R. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

"oI3hpDdTHYw","Wendy D. - NA speaker - ""Clean Life, Fulfilling Life""","Great tape by one of my favorite NA speakers, Wendy D.  She shares her story of addiction and becoming engaged in a recovery process that brings personal transformation.  Very inspirational! 

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

Alcoholics Anonymous | February 8 2013 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 2 ""Sanity"" | ""Lest We Forget..."" One of my favourite meetings in my area is called, ""lest we forget."" A turbulent and difficult meeting on a Sunday night, where we get every type of personality you can imagine, from all over the world because its London, and they know the meeting is called lest we forget. And because local people are forgetful, most of the locals who go to the meeting, have forgotten the name of the meeting, if you ask them what the name is, and even the secretary will have forgotten. Some of the time we are forgetful of what will happen in the insanity which can happen on the way to drink...

Years ago, I was offered a place in a rehab, St Luke's mission, in Kennington, it has been closed for years, some people liked it, and other people hated it, like me. A recycled building with many past uses: including a morgue where I used to do relaxation therapy as part of my internment. Somehow it lost its way. Dealing with people in recovery, the way it was managed and the therapeutic processes were very unclear, both management and councillors were at odds with each other, and their disruptive behaviour and attitudes did more to scar the inmates than help them. When I was there for a few months, it was shocking from the start, and then just got worse, each day a lesson in incremental torture. It seemed to me to be the opposite of fellowship, where fellowship is about love, rehab was about hate. I endured the madness of rehab to my term, and then was told I needed to stay longer to get better. If ever there were a regime designed to encourage relapse by the inmates, St Luke's mission achieved the job with alarming success...

"T_sHfh6yWao","Alcoholics Anonymous | Jan 2 2015 | DonInLondon | Step 1 ""Freedom""","January 2 2014  [ Full daily blog: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/alcoholics-anonymous-jan-2-2014.html ]  AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 1 ""Powerless"" | Alcoholics Anonymous The beginning of a new chapter and a new day. January 1, 2013, bright and sunny, and a relief and a wondering what to do next. I need to start at the beginning again. And what better place to start with some basics of what makes life work for me.

The serenity prayer, which can be said to God, or as an exhortation to God, or depending on your faith and beliefs an exhortation to good, simply the good of life: the serenity prayer, ""God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""

Serenity is a state of mind which can be lived. Serenity in the moment of now, even when life is chaotic, even when life is good, bad and ugly. Serenity needs to be in the moment of now, or it is history, and it is something we try and attain in the future. If we don't have serenity now, and live serenity, what is the point?

And January is a very good month to start again with an understanding of the twelve steps and the twelve traditions. I need to read the twelve and twelve, the twelve steps and the twelve traditions of the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. The absolute bedrock of recovery is living the steps and incorporating the philosophy and the practicality they offer anyone anywhere at any time. And this needs to be part of my morning reflections. I share them and have done for quite a while. Today, being the first day of the New Year, I felt the need to let go some of the publishing I have been doing over the last few years. And just put it in one place rather than a scattergun approach, with blogs, here there and everywhere is not necessarily worthwhile. Or is it? Probably the most important thing is there is a message of experience, strength and hope being shared by many people in whatever way they find appropriate. I just want to be one of many who shares, I don't want to be better or worse than anybody else and I felt like I might be overdoing some elements and crowding out the voices of other people. Sometimes I feel that way. Meetings, I put my hand up to speak, automatically because that is what I feel I need do. And then I shut up, not sure what to do. And these uncertainties are really important, it is part of life, not to know the answers and ask for help.

January 1, 2013, an evening meeting, at one of the venues I like to call a spiritual hut. It is actually a hut and old scouting hut. It now serves many purposes as part of a great big church organisation here in my local community. During the day, it serves as a nursery and in the evenings and weekends can be used for many reasons, providing you pay for it. Anyway, last night as it is now January 2, it was busy, messy, unruly, and full of promise. Many newcomers, many people from other meetings and abroad from Europe from far flung places like the Americas... A real mix of real alcoholics getting to grips with reality, or not getting to grips with anything!

The impact on me? I love hurly-burly, I love talking to new people as the meeting numbers grow and we meet people we know and people we don't know. The queue for the teas and coffee, seems to take a lifetime and is eating at the time before the meeting. I chat to a friend, find a seat and sit down before the seat is lost to someone else. Standing room only on New Year's Day... continues...

"lm05KQVLJNs","Alcoholics Anonymous","The General Service Office (GSO) of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) India, which operates from a tiny municipal school in Byculla, was bursting at its seams as nearly 100 AA members and volunteers attended to a torrent of calls after a national TV show flashed AA's helpline numbers and website details, on Sunday, July 1, 2012.

In its ninth episode which first aired at 11am, Satyamev Jayate focused on alcoholism and featured interviews with experts and recovering alcoholics, including AA member Laxman. As the show's producer and host Aamir Khan announced the number on air, AA offices across the country braced themselves.

Gajanan, Rotated trustee of AA India who was at the AA office in Mumbai, said, ""The number was first flashed on the show at 11.37am and at 11.40am we received the first call.Within 20 minutes, the AA website had crashed. At 12.30am, all telephone lines were jammed and missed calls started piling up. Within the next hour, we received 8,600 missed calls."" By 4pm, AA centers across India had received 13,000 calls which jumped up to 28,000 by 7 in the evening after the show aired. At the time of going to print, More than 31,000 calls were recorded.

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of recovering alcoholics who follow the universally accepted 12 Step program for recovery from addiction. Mr. Gnyaneshwar, general manager, AA India, said, ""After a lot of groundwork, the show's research team came to the conclusion that AA programme is a reliable recovery source for alcoholism that is available pan-India and completely free of cost.""

"N2QdhyM4J4c","Alcoholics Anonymous | November 13 | DonInLondon | Step 11 ""Truth Love Wisdom""","2014 Full Daily Blog Link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/alcoholics-anonymous-blog-november-13.html November 13 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 11 Daily Meditation Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog: http://oddbook.co ] Today's Daily Reflections: ""self aware, prayer and meditation: looking outwards..."" Yes, self-aware, and at the same time prayer, meditation is about unity, service and recovery. Looking outwards rather than being self-absorbed or selfish. Looking at the big picture, how we fit into the big picture, not running the whole show, simply being part of something, with and around people, places and things...

In those darkest days, when the old behaviour and addictive ways were out of control, I could not see the impact I had myself or other people. There was consternation and fear inside me and those who kept on trying to help became fearful that I could not help myself and they could not save me from myself: that is the nature of addiction and no way out. My experience is joining the fellowship made it possible to learn and be supported every single day by a large number of people who were all in recovery, from a few hours to a great number of years. Some say it takes a village to raise a child... And for me to get into recovery and stay in recovery it has taken a fellowship. I have gratitude for everyone who made this possible one day at a time...

Being self-aware and able to pray and meditate, whether we believe in God or not, improves our outlook on a daily basis. With practice, being self-aware, praying and meditating is not a lengthy process. Most often comes down to this for me: ""how am I feeling?"" And, ""why?"" And then, ""what can I do?"" Three simple questions. And it only takes moments to find balance, knowing my mood, how it is impacting on my thinking and the actions which may follow. And if I don't know what to do, I can ask for help rather than try to tough it out and pretend to be okay when I'm not...

Every day I am challenged by my old ways and the darker side, where fear, putting on a brave face and ego will keep me selfish in my outlook. And equally challenged to live to a new set of principles which offer: faith in the next right thing, courage to change and confidence which grows with the experience. Step six the old ways and being stuck in a defensive attitude, or step seven: working on my shortcomings to be open, honest and willing to change. Sometimes one step back, and then two steps forward, or any combination. Life experience offers the challenge, the principles of the twelve steps and twelve traditions, enabling everyone to have more personal choices and personal freedom one day at a time...

How am I feeling today? The answer is simple, right now, somewhat vague and listening to the thrum of London waking up. It's going to be rush hour for millions, trying to cram in as much as they can all day long. Walking to bus stops, walking to trains and tubes and so many gazing into their mobile phones... I wonder how well each person can look out. Looking outward, self-aware and weighing up what is going on, included in a world which suits them or suits no one... In balance? Or driven out of balance? And my plan in all this: to be open, honest and willing. To help and support, to cherish people, and befriend anyone caught in difficulty if and when the time is appropriate today...

"XNLmP8LNJiM","Alcoholics Anonymous Coercion in Therapy at Samaritan Counseling Center of the Capital Region","Professionals in Alcoholics Anonymous are illegally coercing clients into AA, even when it is evidently counterproductive, and they are willfully negligent towards clients who claim to have been harmed by AA and want to explore alternatives and avoid the AA-dominated recovery industry.

After about a half a year of sucessfully exploring alternatives and deciding firmly that AA was confusing me more than helping, AA members involved with my case began twisting any lapse into proof that I couldn't think for myself, and was an 'alcoholic' with all the character defects, denial, and lack of faith attributed to the alcoholic of the Big Book. My therapist told me that she was required to recommend me to go to AA meetings, and eventually terminated me because I decided it was not helpful for me, even though I wanted to continue the discussion.

In June 2014 I filed complaints which were completely ignored. The content of my complaint was similar to this video, and also included a class action complaint about the ethics issues involved when social workers bring their AA religious beliefs to bear on clients. http://www.rational.org/pdf_files/nasw_complaint.pdf   It was a clear message that I had no interest in seeing any counselor who is an AA member. They would not meet with me unless I went to AA. 

Since my complaint seemed to be willfully neglected (there was no follow up, and I only received a termination letter referring me again to the same 12-step interventionist treatment I had refused), I was left in some ways completely confused and hurt, and in other ways more and more sure that there is something seriously wrong with AA's involvement in social work.

The facts are clear. AA is deemed religious in nature by federal circuit courts. Any religious coercion by licensed professionals is against the law, and AA has no place in professional treatment. 

Really, there is nothing funny about serious and deadly effects of this malpractice, and it is not something to be brushed aside and simply accepted and forgiven while it continues to happen over and over again. People are being mistreated and left worse off, and then ignored. But it's not just the termination that bothered me. They had my reviews removed from Yelp, and had my account deleted when I tried to repost it. This is criminal.

So this video shows my experience and the continual retraumatization I experienced by these organizations I went to in hopes of finding professional help in understanding the failure of Alcoholics Anonymous: Samaritan Counseling Center of the Capital Region (David Olsen Executive Director, Jenness Clairmont former Clinical Director and board member on the NYS Office of Professions, Oona Edmands), Saint Peters Addiction Recovery Center (SPARC), Recovery Resource Center of Albany (James Garrett), Pinnacle Behavioral Health, Capital District Psychiatric Center (NYS OMH), and others.","UCItdbBgZT-xowJtKiW9ByBg","2014-10-08T22:38:28.000Z","[u'alcoholics anonymous coercion AA 12-step meetings alcoholism alcohol addictions treatment', u'Saint Peters Addiction Recovery Center', u'Harm Reduction Abstinence and Moderation Support HAMS', u'addiction treatment', u'Samaritan Counseling Center of the Capital Region', u'12 step rehab', u'David Olsen', u'Jenness Clairmont', u'James Garrett', u'12-step coercion', u'samaritan institute', u'NYS Office of Professions', u'mishandled transference', u'informed consent', u'censorship', u'yelp', u'delmar', u'axis 2', u'13th step', u'MBSR']","40","6107","0","6","527"
"8dYIWrOphIw","Alcoholics Anonymous: The Truth","Peer Support (according to SAMHSA and Recovery to Practice) should never be coerced or forced.  All groups, including SMART Recovery, SOS, WFS, LifeRing, and any 12 Step group should be voluntary only.  Dictating to a person, whether under threat or punishment, to attend a support group is unethical.  Another area AA fails is Peer Support should be open minded and open to other forms of support.  In AA meetings, mentioning SMART is an ""outside issue.""  Another area AA fails at is education, since the education AA provides is limited to AA literature-- mainly their 1939 Big Book that remains largely unchanged since it was first published.  In the Big Book, there is no mention of new treatments or new scientific discoveries about addiction.  

Contact your local alcohol and drug funding boards, rehabs, and medical communities.  Contact local courts and ask them to stop coercing/forcing people into support groups.  Together, we can make a difference.  I realize my video uses ""strong"" images to convey my points; However, every time AA fails a person and they commit suicide, give up, use more and greater quantities, or even die a stronger image comes to mind:  An image of an unjust medical and justice system.  The 12 Step treatment industry is a 35 Billion Dollar industry that thrives on ""failure"" in treatment.  

Let's end this 12 Step dictatorship once and for all.

"bVc91bzBY00","Alcoholics Anonymous | September 22 | DonInLondon | Step 9 ""Amends Into Action""","2014 Full Daily Blog Link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/alcoholics-anonymous-blog-video_22.html September 22 2013 [ Full daily blog link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/alcoholics-anonymous-sept-22.html ] | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 9 Amends In Action Alcoholics Anonymous Today's AA daily reflection 2012: ""the limitless lode of truth and hope one day at a time..."" When I share with a newcomer, ""what happened, the journey and where I am today"" I'm not surprised just how often I hear ""it seems like it's okay for you now, but what about me!"" Without the spiritual principles of the programme I can get very frustrated and very quickly feel like giving up and revert to, ""yes, what about me, you ungrateful newcomer today!""

The spiritual principles which I need remind myself to practice every day with everyone: to live life ""real"" ~ ""Forgiveness"" ""Acceptance"" ""Surrender"" ""Faith"" ""Open-mindedness"" ""Honesty"" ""Willingness"" ""Inventory"" ""Amends"" ""Humility"" ""Persistence"" ""Spiritual-Living"" ""Service."" First principle I need to remind myself of today is forgiveness. I forgive everyone everywhere everything as my starting point or I will be overwhelmed when people criticise me and don't get where I am coming from today...

Forgiveness: starts with me, the twelve steps and twelve traditions helped to straighten me out so I could see where I came from, the abject misery of addiction into recovery. All the things I did along the way based on trying to fix life for myself and for those around me were completely distorted and in the end addiction was the master and I was the slave. As I have old behaviour still haunting from time to time, when I start with forgiveness and why those old ways can still come back at me, I need to forgive those closest sometimes when they feel like giving up on other people and some when they stop forgiving can revert to old hurts and horrors...

That was then and this is now: ""forgiveness and acceptance is necessary for however long we head back to denial as a starting point on any given day"" how do we share our journey with family, are our family interested in how we recovered and anyone we still have in our lives? And as we were unable to find recovery on our own we cannot expect family and friends and any significant others to understand what they have gone through as a direct result of our behaviour and it is no wonder that we often find ourselves in fear and trying to defend the past. I found out some time after I got to recovery that my mother and my sister had been in contact with Al anon, and thank goodness they did. How could they manage their pain about me on their own...?

Then there is: ""forgiveness, acceptance and a surrender to the truth of today and how it is."" Surrendering to the truth of today, the old times, ""that was then,"" and today, ""this is now."" Very many people in our lives will still be stuck in the history of what happened back then and they will remind us constantly and sometimes with a burning rage inside them, I saw this in my mother many times and it was about me, it was about my dad and it was about my brother, seeing a disease rampant in the generations. I realise forgiveness is a daily endeavour for anyone and sometimes surrender to the truth is very difficult when a person has not yet expressed their rage about the past and the impact on the innocent that the disease of addiction inflicts arbitrarily on everyone...

When the lid comes off from those we have hurt, it can be the most painful of experiences for everyone. The judgement and the prejudice digs deepest at those primary emotions of love and hate. In recovery we are no strangers to those feelings of self-loathing and self-hate, self-harm and self-prejudice. And when the weapon of the past is inflicted over and over we can crumble in abject misery, anger and hateful feelings we try to avoid and we live a justifiable horror and an injustice and resentment can hurt so deeply it may as well be a spear through the heart. As we could not recover on our own, it is the same for those who suffered with us through those tragic years, they too need help if and when they ask for it from us... Or anyone else they choose!

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

"3SiQTWgZz0k","Alcoholics Anonymous | July 12 | DonInLondon | Step 7 ""Courage To Change""","Giving up center stage: July 12 ~ For without some degree of humility, no alcoholic can stay sober at all. . . Without it, they cannot live to much useful purpose, or, in adversity, be able to summon the faith that can meet any emergency. [12 & 12]
Why do I balk at the word ""humility""? I am not humbling myself toward other people, but toward God, as I understand Him. Humbly means ""to show submissive,"" and by being humble I realize I am not the center of the universe. When I was drinking, I was consumed by pride and self-centeredness. I felt the entire world revolved around me, that I was master of my destiny. Humility enables me to depend more on God to help me overcome obstacles, to
help me with my own imperfections, so that I may grow spiritually. I must solve more difficult problems to increase my proficiency and, as I encounter life's stumbling blocks, I must learn to overcome them through God's help. Daily communion with God demonstrates my humility and provides me with the realization that an entity more powerful than I is willing to help me if I cease trying to play God myself.

A society of human beings working together in unity, service and recovery. One primary purpose, a desire to stop drinking and help others recover from alcoholism. Developing personal choices, learning the can do of life and the cannot do of life and the wisdom to know the difference. Just for a day and then...

The world is full of people telling others what to do, the world is full of marketing people determining what we ought to be doing and what we ought to be having. The world is full of people telling each other what to do. People, places and things can drive us mad on any given day and make a return to old feelings, attitudes and behaviour very possible because we feel good, we feel bad and we feel the ugly of life. With all these challenges in life where people are telling us what to do, how on earth do we stop doing something so harmful, our lives are lost in oblivion, lost and self-harm and cut short because we cannot stop hurting ourselves? Alone, it feels impossible, but the world tells us we ought to be able to stop harming ourselves. In our fellowship, we recognise that unity around one single issue, keeping sober one day at a time can open the door to a new life of freedom and usefulness... And of course, to determine your choices, and you will learn what your usefulness is...

Every single day, we will feel judged by other people, and by one other in the here and now, the critic inside us which looks to the dark side of what people might be thinking, how we appear and what the world thinks of us. We are our own worst enemy when it comes to judgement. In my case I was never satisfied with my own situation, and felt I could do better. ""Could do better,"" was something to be found on a school report, a college report, a work performance review and I wrote it, whilst others judging me might be quite favourable, I was always concerned to improve. In fellowship, unity, service and recovery is about progress one day at a time. And it's more than that, it is acceptance of the truth of now, and in the truth of now, nothing is absolutely perfect, the best it can be is imperfectly perfect, in the ever present, present moment of now...

From the first meeting to the second meeting of fellowship, when I really did not understand what was going on, there was a five-year gap. In my first meeting of AA, I had been pushed through the doors by an anxious family member who told me to go in and sort myself out. The irony? Being pushed through the doors into a meeting of AA, and all these smiling people, some I knew as neighbours, health club friends and arts club members. And of course, a scattering of famous individuals living in my area. All I could see on my first visit were the differences, and the one similarity eluded me completely. That I was in a meeting of alcoholics, and strange as it may seem, I too was an alcoholic, the difference for me was simple. Looking back I was in denial and even though I was an alcoholic, and I admitted and accepted I was an alcoholic when I was there, as soon as I left the meeting, I rejected the notion of being an alcoholic and proceeded to the pub at the end of the road. Another five years of agony to follow... [continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

"e_-DqXOzk4Y","Joe McF. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-03-02T00:05:01.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","0","454","0","0","2"

I have cherished memories of my dad. When I was about fifteen years old, he really lost the plot when it came to living. At best, a lovable rogue, at worst he was conning himself and he was a conman. Drink was his best friend in the end, and he was lonely. I learned how to drink like him. At first, drink helped me feel life, and then over the years I felt nothing but oblivion with the last drink in hand...

My last drink, in a hostel in King's Cross ""The Cartwright Hotel"": After walking the streets, I don't know how long for now, I went to a hospital emergency department and asked for help. Good fortune on that day to get a psychiatric assessment, some advice to go to a homeless unit and then King's Cross. The hostel for degraded people just like me: drugged and drugging, addled by drink and drinking. The room: stained by life and me with a bottle of vodka in hand. Cracking the bottle open, a gulp and swallow... I said to myself, ""if I drink this bottle, it's the end of me."" I don't know why, I just felt this was my last chance. No matter how horrible the room and everything, I poured the vodka down the sink and sat until dawn shivering. A warm June morning, and I was frozen stiff...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

Thank goodness it's a one-day programme. Learning to live to good conscience offers a daily opportunity to make progress and we are not looking to be perfect, simply we are imperfectly perfect! Every day we will be pulled in many directions, the inner voice muttering, the outer world chattering and somewhere we find balance in the moment...

Twelve practical steps for practical living. In step four, an inventory of our liabilities and our assets. Step six, liabilities or defects of character which we explore daily and assets we develop in step seven again developing each and every day. My liabilities, fear without foundation, putting on a brave face to cover up shame and guilt and not being good enough and ego, eggshell brittle easily smashed by harsh moments. My assets, developing a faith in doing the next right thing, courage to keep on changing and building confidence by learning from my mistakes each and every day...

In today's AA reflection, it is all about doing, being free to make choices and about endeavour. It is about making good and repairing where we can, learning from what happened and doing things different. It is all about working out what is good today, what we can do and cannot do and working in a way which helps us keep to good conscience and for the good of everyone. It's not about me, it is about everyone today...

A peaceful start my morning, my mood? I haven't developed a mood yet! Which makes me smile and so my feelings and mood are pretty good in the moment. Morning routine, step one, powerlessness over people places and things and everything can be discussed in what next today. Step two, a day of sanity and happiness on offer as long as I don't think I'm in charge. Let go and let in the world, people places and things so I get greater understanding of what is possible today. And the serenity prayer for can do and cannot do and learning the wisdom as we go moment by moment...

I do not speak for Alcoholics Anonymous I speak for myself. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of unique and authentic people who speak for themselves where they will to share experience, strength and hope about recovery on a daily basis. Anonymity affords sanctuary to find how to live sober and be open, honest and willing to learn life day by day. For me ""truth,"" ""love"" and ""wisdom"" offer the best spiritual experience by living reality today.

Letting go the old life of fear, pride and ego, and especially willpower which isolated everything we did, and now seeing that it was okay to change, with courage and faith and confidence opened the door to new living. On any given day, if we are uncomfortable in our own skin, we can ask for help, not only in fellowship, we can ask for help from anyone anywhere at any time if they have the knowledge, skill and the willingness to help us. Willingness to help from other people is only possible if we have the humility to ask. If we demand, if we feel entitled if we expect help ""just because"" we are unlikely to receive any help at all. Being open to what the problem is, being honest with people and being willing to tell the truth, most often opens the door to help. Humility is not grovelling, it is a two way street of giving and receiving today... [continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

Adjustable legs in recovery, just like a tripod..."" Sometimes I don't feel very unified, sometimes I'm not able to be of service and sometimes recovery is difficult. It would be difficult to devote three equal amounts of time to unity, service and recovery. Three legs of a stool, three even legs, will produce a level stable platform. In fellowship we work together, to provide a stable platform for everyone to keep their balance in recovery. Sometimes one of my legs may fall short, fortunately there are many legs in recovery!

If I cannot help you, which is a very common occurrence, there are probably people who can. And that is the beauty of fellowship, working together in unison, we make up for each other's gaps in abilities, skills, time and acceptability to the newcomer. If somebody asks me for help in recovery, I do ask myself the basic question, ""am I the right person to help this person today?"" Just because I happen to be in front of them, or the end of a telephone, or at the end of some connection or other, I need to ask myself, am I ready? And sometimes I am not the right person, I'm not in the right place, and I might be overwhelmed by other matters. So I need everything in the toolkit to help the newcomer, knowing other people who can help or might help, knowing where to get help and how quickly it can be marshalled. It's not about me, it is about unity, service and recovery...

On my desk at the moment, glancing to my left, copy of the daily reflections, and a copy of the twelve steps and twelve traditions. I certainly open the daily reflections every day, and most days the twelve steps are working in practice, practising the twelve steps in daily life. And with the twelve steps and twelve traditions at my elbow, I do read through the twelve traditions regularly. I accept the words as they are and when they were written. The world continues to move along, different outlooks, different attitudes and behaviour, and different perceptions about addiction and recovery. Maybe one perception needs most adjustment in these enlightened times, the attitude of self-prejudice which blights personal recovery, and hinders very often the concepts of unity, service and recovery...

When we get beyond self-prejudice, that is a feeling that in some way addiction was a personal choice and that we are to blame, recovery is then a choice to be made one day at a time. And even then, recovery is contingent on our spiritual condition. Our spiritual condition is knowing what our feelings are in the moment of now, and being able to cope. And if we cannot cope, seek help as soon as possible. Our spiritual condition is contingent on what is happening right now, and sometimes when the world throws us into turmoil, we are very vulnerable. And if we do not seek help soonest, we can almost be back in the malady in the blink of an eye. Nobody is immune to life and what it may throw our way. One day at a time, we do the best we can with what we have, and if we should stumble for whatever reason, we keep coming back and find balance with the help of our fellows in recovery...

Emotional health, where I understand the feelings I am experiencing as life hits me in the face full on. Spiritual health is where all feelings any human has can be experienced and the impact they have is understood. Feelings impact my thinking and my actions in the moment of now...

Often we can find ourselves in a new situation where old feelings of fear are set alight again. A natural reaction when we encounter danger of some sort or other. Old patterns of reaction and action can come into the real moment of now, when they are not necessarily the best response to what is going on. We can suddenly recall old times and old events and the need to cover up and suppress, reminders of old guilt and shame can close us down very quickly. Until we break the patterns of the past, we can still remain stuck. Letting go fear, anger and resentment will always help. We need to forgive ourselves, and we need to forgive the pain and hurt we felt as a result of other people's behaviour and we need forgive them. People are the best they can be in the moment of now, and sometimes it is very far from acceptable in our own eyes...

December is all about sharing a message in the literature book, ""AA daily reflections."" Sharing a message of experience, strength and hope is what we do by demonstrating a new way to live by what we do and the actions people can see. We become different in recovery, if that is what we are learning to do. We do not become puritans, we don't become saints, we become human and very sensitive human beings, actually, that is what we can become if we do change. Some people do not change in recovery, they remain abstinent from alcohol, and a dry drunk, because they do not deal with the emotional and spiritual aspects of living in the moment. An angry dry drunk, is a really good example to newcomers of what happens when the twelve step principles are not being utilised in practice. Mind you, each and everyone in fellowship can be a dry drunk. Depending on what happens today, we can encounter good, bad and ugly situations which bring out the best in us, or the worst in us. If we are self-aware, we do get a choice in our behaviour and outcomes. Today, just for today, we can be free, and it is a choice in the moment...

The AA daily reflection today, ""love with no price tag."" In doing twelfth step work, actually, as I write, I realise twelve step work is not work, it is practising a principle of sharing a message of recovery. We may be sharing with a newcomer or somebody just uncertain about their current situation with regard to addiction or somebody trying to help another person with addiction. By being open, honest and willing to share the truth as we understand it, there is no price tag attached to truth. Unless of course we feel the truth might hurt us in some way. Actually the only thing which can hurt us is our attitude toward the truth. Do we really want people who are prejudiced against us to rule our behaviour as an alcoholic in recovery? I for one don't, and that is my opinion and not suggestion, it is a personal choice when it comes to anonymity...

And abuse of trust, within the law. Call up a hospital, and ask about a patient as if we are a relative to elicit private information. A prankster call for the entertainment the populace. Having made the call, got the information and broadcast across the world, and someone involved, committed suicide. Those who thought the prank funny, those who initiated the prank were perfectly within the law which led to a person taking their own life. And we look for the fault in the person who could not stand tough and see the funny side of the breach of trust. Outrage, denial and grief permeate the airwaves. Deriving pleasure from humiliation of another human being for their gullibility has sent many to an early grave. Ask any reformed bully how they feel these days... And ask any living victim how they feel about breach of trust these days...

A revelation one January morning: after a few hours of oblivion and hard drinking. I was never going to beat my addiction to alcohol on my own. I needed to ask for help, and I phoned a professional I had been avoiding for months. The words, humility and gratitude, had not been in my vocabulary for years. Humility to ask for help and grateful someone was willing to listen to me...

There is a new public information clip being shown on TV about taking time out from drinking alcohol. A humorous cartoon: trying to deliver a message about the danger of drinking too much. Taking time out a few days a week and not to drink and mentioning all the unpleasant ailments which can happen if we drink too much. I hope it works for some people. A drinker, however, is more likely to believe that the information contained in the TV clip is for other people who have a problem and not them! Even though it can be obvious to anyone else who does not drink to excess, the message is lost to those already dependent on their best friend, ""alcohol."" Seeing a clear message of danger about drinking too much and continuing to drink, regardless of the consequences, is where denial starts and denial of the truth and reality is very common. When drink is no longer joyful and convivial, and habitual and never ending, we have lost the plot...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

"fKSvqty7Tv4","Alcoholics Anonymous | February 12 | DonInLondon | Step 2 ""Sanity"" |","February 12 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 2 | 2012 | Today's AA daily reflection: ""the root of our troubles"" selfishness and self-centredness! When do we realise that we have been selfish and self-centred? Most likely a question to be asked, every day in our personal conduct. When it comes to recognising selfish and self-centred in relation to our addiction, it is almost impossible to see with any clarity. From ignorance of our condition, to denial and then to admit and accept takes time when it comes to changing our outlook day by day...

I was just watching a TV programme all about rules, laws and regulations which apply in different forms of religion. Our Fellowship, Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organisation, but many fellows in our society do hold religious views. I'm grateful for the early founders of our Fellowship who suggested there are no rules, laws or regulations which exclude anyone anywhere reaching out the help. There are suggestions about how we conduct ourselves in Fellowship and it always remains a personal decision about what we can do and cannot do today...

The twelve steps and the twelve traditions. Steps for personal development, open honest and willing to change. Traditions for unity service and recovery. The steps to stop us committing suicide, the traditions to stop us committing homicide. All about tolerance and love for other people and compassion as we learn together sharing experience strength and hope. This is why Fellowship works for me, not selfish and not self-centred as people when it comes to sharing a message on learning how to live life again and again and again...

I do realise over the years that bravado covered up my shortcomings. My shortcomings, not understanding the nature of faith (simple faith rather than religious faith), courage and confidence to meet real-life, that is life on life's terms and not some fiction I had thought up. Today I do have courage, faith and confidence based on what I know and the ability to keep on learning how life may be today. I can be a part of society and included contingent on my understanding that life is changing and I can be part of reality today...

Selfishness--self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of all our troubles

Two meetings in a day: First meeting: ""Just for today"" this morning, we were packed in like sardines! Newcomers to old timers, sober today. People sharing what is happening now, the themes were all about what was disturbing us in the moment, good things and bad things and as always acceptance seemed to be the key. It is the key if we can find it!

And Second meeting: Tonight was ""courage to change."" We can and do change every day. Experience is our teacher, not just our own, but the experience everyone shares. Practice makes progress and perfection is not our goal. Our goal is understanding what we can do and what we cannot do and simply learning the difference...

AA Daily: THE ROOT OF OUR TROUBLES ~ FEBRUARY 12, Selfishness--self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of all our troubles. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 62

How amazing the revelation that the world, and everyone in it, can get along just fine with or without me. What a relief to know that people, places and things will be perfectly okay without my control and direction. And how wordlessly wonderful to come to believe that a power greater than me exists separate and apart from myself. I believe that the feeling of separation I experience between me and God will one day vanish. In the meantime, faith must serve as the pathway to the center of my life.

What on earth is this about? And why did I have to do this? First and foremost in fellowship, and with twelve 

steps, everything is a suggestion. Step four, helped me identify my personal conduct and the liabilities which kept me stuck in an old life which gave me reason to drink: personal traits of excessive fear, pride and ego needed to be let go. And of course there is a 

balance the more I let go of fear, pride and ego, the more room for courage to change, faith in doing the next right thing and confidence to make mistakes and learn from them and ask for help and guidance at any time...

Natural instincts are good! ""If there were no social instinct, if men cared nothing for the society of one another, there would be no society. So these natural desires, for sex, for material and emotional security, and for companionship: are perfectly necessary and right 

and surely God-Given."" Step four, and the way I write it to read, fear less moral inventory. When we look back at our conduct over the years, the good of what we have done and the excesses and extremes caused by? The cause and the effect are really important to 

know. Where we have been driven to extremes, extremes of fear, extremes of pride and extremes of ego, there are many ways to write a personal fear less moral inventory and how you do this is usually with the guide, of either using the big book, the big book and a 

sponsor, and depending on your openness and willingness and honesty, you will find many who can help you start this process. In my opinion, three columns as in the big book is a simple, practical starting point... [continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

Our nonconformist fellowship opens the door to anyone anywhere who has a desire to stop drinking. If there had been any issues of money or conformity undoubtedly the fellowship would be a lot different. And I would be dead...

The longer we are in fellowship, to the old-timer who is learning the wisdom of life, the openness of our fellowship becomes more obvious. To the bleeding Deacon, still stuck in old attitudes and old behaviours around manipulation and control and wanting it their way or no way, the openness of the fellowship makes them awkward, loud, complaining and bitter that things aren't the way they used to be... I was looking online to find fellowship and recovery sites, the number is overwhelming. At the same time, face-to-face, and in meetings, I still feel the power and the wisdom of experience, strength and hope shared. And then it seems, it is shared in many places over and over again. Fellowship is working and so are other means of recovery today... Without fellowship, it is doubtful if all these other means of recovery could even be contemplated let alone available to many more who have never heard of Alcoholics Anonymous...

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more...""

"0cWXhK64KiA","Alcoholics Anonymous | May 12 | DonInLondon | Step 5 ""Share Your Truth""","May 12 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 5 Admit And Accept | Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.com/ ] Today's AA daily reflection: ""the past is over..."" Yes the past is done and not forgotten as revealed in step four. The feelings which led to tormented thinking and exaggerated actions. Understanding how the past impacts today and the actions we put in to improve our emotional and spiritual outlook, the twelve steps working each and every day...

Writing our step four and then sharing with another human being, letting out all that we have done, the good and the bad and the ugliness caused by addiction. Expression of how it was to another human being and done in a way to understand why life turned out the way it did is so revealing and so useful if we have time to learn and time to change. We need compassion and forgiveness and at the same time be accepting of the consequences today...

In step five, sharing the extremes of where life took us is just part of the healing process and finding acceptance. Acceptance of the past does not mean we will forget, quite the opposite. As we progress through the steps, we realise that acceptance is a daily activity if we are to maintain a new way of life. Step ten and spotcheck inventory highlight daily where changes need be made in thinking and action. Step ten and gratitude help keep me in balance moment by moment...

Actions speak louder than words and change the way we feel about ourselves and the world. Through action as our feelings change, then our thinking process changes and so do the actions which follow. Emotional and spiritual: knowing my mood on a daily basis or simply from moment to moment as life impacts on me is key. If I am angry, I think angry and may react angrily. If I'm happy, I think happy and react happily. If I cherish and love you, with courage and action, you may cherish and love me today...

I do not speak for Alcoholics Anonymous I speak for myself. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of unique and authentic people who speak for themselves where they will to share experience, strength and hope about recovery on a daily basis. Anonymity affords sanctuary to find how to live sober and be open, honest and willing to learn life day by day. For me ""truth,"" ""love"" and ""wisdom"" offer the best spiritual experience by living reality today. Into the fabric of recovery from alcoholism are woven the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions, steps to be open, honest and willing to learn, traditions to live unity, service and recovery.

This was made while in an airport so I apologize for the background noise.
I start to look at Step 8 and 9
Step 8 Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.
Step 9 Made direct amends to these people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

Tomorrow I will expand on this and share a little of my personal experience and insight.

Congratulations on another 24 friends

Everyone everywhere is the best they can be in the moment of now. It does not matter whether people are being good, bad, or behaving in an ugly way. It is the best they can be right now, and was the best they could be back in the day. This applies to you too, you are the best you can be now. Looking back with hindsight we have all the wisdom of what happened and we can change the way we are one day at a time...

And what about the ""higher power?"" When does it work? And why do we feel that some days there is no higher power and there is only darkness? Hungry, angry, lonely and tired. H. A. L. T. When we feel isolated and alone, physically and mentally tired, we cannot feel a power greater than ourselves. Unless we actively seek out the company of others, so we can be included in something bigger than us, we have no connection to what we need most, ""inclusion, friendship, affection and unconditional love."" My higher power, always works through people, is there in fellowship, can be there in family, can be found if we have the courage, faith and confidence to share the truth about what is going on and how we are feeling today...

We often hear that life will take on new meaning, when we are in meetings of the fellowship. And we start to understand what it is to be in an emotional and spiritual journey of life. We know what our feelings are like never before, we understand what feelings do to our thinking and our actions in the moment. Deconstructing the old ways of life, where ego, fear and putting on a brave face was normal, becomes very irritating in early days. Hiding away and not telling the truth had become our standard and now in recovery, telling the truth and being open, honest and willing to change takes courage one day at a time...

One of my difficulties in early recovery, understanding the ideas in the twelve step program was very easy. I could understand the concepts and think my way through the twelve steps and what they were designed to do, simply to give me my freedom back. But I was looking for a fast track in recovery, I wanted to speed up recovery and prove to the world what a clever man I was. Certainly I was clever, and intelligent and for long time able to make a living very well. But when it came to the real meaning of life, I was withdrawn, hidden and very good at hiding away and not dealing with feelings. Learning to deal with feelings, and find the words to express my feelings truthfully, proved to be a really big struggle, because feelings happen, and I did not like some of those feelings I had. I like to have good feelings, but dealing with feelings which were considered bad, I had no clue how to deal or even express them truthfully...

When I heard people talk about the language of the heart, I knew what they were talking about, but I didn't really understand where those feelings were in me. I understood desire, but I did not understand love too well. I had come to a place where I felt I was worthless and had no right to live. And the idea of learning how to love myself, so I might be able to learn how to love others unconditionally, it was really tough, expressing feelings which I did not want to have and did not want to own up to. In one way or another, we hear about the seven vices and the seven virtues, seven vices, where our feelings are negative and extreme and the seven virtues, where our feelings are positive and probably extreme as well. The back and forth between vices and virtues, and somewhere in each moment there is balance is a daily activity. When people say they put things behind them, I realise they may have put some things behind them, but vices and virtues will crop up all the time because we are simply human, very human beings living in the moment of now...

Alcohol detoxification

Alcohol detoxification (alcohol detox) is a process by which a heavy drinker's system is brought back to normal after being used to having alcohol in the body on a continual basis. Serious alcohol addiction results in a decrease in production of GABA, a reuptake inhibitor, because alcohol acts to replace it. Precipitous withdrawal from long-term alcohol addiction without medical management can cause severe health problems and can be fatal. 

Drug detoxification

Drug detoxification (Drug Detox) is used to reduce or relieve withdrawal symptoms while helping the addicted individual adjust to living without drug use; drug detoxification is not meant to treat addiction but rather an early step in long-term treatment. Detoxification may be achieved drug free or may use medications as an aspect of treatment. Often drug detoxification and treatment will occur in a community program that lasts several months and takes place in a residential rather than medical center.

Detox, Treatment and Rehab Centers
Medical detox should be sought if you: abuse opiates, excessively abuse alcohol, or are currently taking opiate replacements (methadone, suboxone), or abuse benzodiazepines (xanax, nirvam).

Detoxification varies depending on the location of treatment, but most detox centers provide treatment to avoid the symptoms of physical withdrawal to alcohol & other drugs. Most also incorporate counseling and therapy during detox to help with the consequences of withdrawal.
In 2001, the 436,000 admissions for detoxification in the United States accounted for 25% of all substance abuse treatment reported to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Among the detoxification admissions, the primary substance of abuse was alcohol (50%), opiates (33%), cocaine (10%), marijuana (2%), stimulants (2%), and other drugs (3%). Detoxification admissions were more likely to have had five or more previous admissions (26%) compared with all other admissions (9%).

Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (S.L.A.A.) in Ventura County California is a Twelve Step, Twelve Tradition-oriented fellowship based on the model pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. The only qualification for S.L.A.A. membership is a desire to stop living out a pattern of sex and love addiction. S.L.A.A. is supported entirely through the contributions of its membership, and is free to all who need it.
To counter the destructive consequences of sex and love addiction we draw on five major resources:
1.Sobriety. Our willingness to stop acting out in our own personal bottom-line addictive behavior on a daily basis.
2.Sponsorship/Meetings. Our capacity to reach out for the supportive fellowship within S.L.A.A.
3.Steps. Our practice of the Twelve Step program of recovery to achieve sexual and emotional sobriety.
4.Service. Our giving back to the S.L.A.A. community what we continue to freely receive.
5.Spirituality. Our developing a relationship with a Power greater than ourselves which can guide and sustain us in recovery.
What is Sex And Love Addiction?
We in S.L.A.A. believe that sex and love addiction is a progressive illness which cannot be cured but which, like many illnesses, can be arrested. It may take several forms including, but not limited to a compulsive need for sex, extreme dependency on one or many people, or a chronic preoccupation with romance, intrigue, or fantasy. An obsessive compulsive pattern, either sexual or emotional, or both, exists in which relationships or sexual activities have become increasingly destructive to career, family and sense of self-respect. Sex addiction and love addiction, if left unchecked, always gets worse. However, if we follow a simple program which has proven successful for scores of other men and women with the same illness, we can recover.","UCFxRw9cy5KatX0gO8qeuYyA","2012-05-10T18:12:24.000Z","[u'SLAA;', u'Ventura', u'County;', u'Sex', u'Addicts;', u'Anonymous;', u'sex', u'addiction', u'twelve', u'step', u'California']","2209","0","2","2"

That is not the way it is written in the AA daily reflection and it is not understood that way by many. The suggestion in the traditions is, that anonymity is the spiritual foundation for the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. I don't find it disagreeable, however, truth is my spiritual foundation. The more you know the truth of me, the better the choices to engage or disengage. It saves a lot of time to tell the truth about me...

Over the years, that is my years in sobriety, the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous has been my sanctuary and the sanctuary of many other people to keep on learning how life can be without the need to fix with a drink or any other behaviour which pops up as a result of sobriety. We humans are evolving through our lifetime, and as we are evolving, the same is true for the fellowship of AA, family, community and society. The world is evolving and the understanding that humanity is gaining through time most often is learning the truth of now, moment by moment. The more we understand the truth of now, we are in the spiritual moment, ever present imperfectly perfect moment of now...

As a fellowship provided sanctuary, it also provided a way of living to a set of principles which have a timeless quality and work in all conditions. How well the twelve steps work in all conditions depends on how well I am as a human being on a daily basis. Some days I have the twelve steps in mind, and then on other days I can be forgetful about the twelve steps and life becomes more difficult. Twelve steps to help me with my behaviour, twelve steps not to judge others and their behaviour, I say it again, twelve steps to help me and not to judge other people...

A lovely meeting last night in the sanctuary and companionship of fellowship. I don't share about specifics, and I don't share about people specifically. I can share that I was there at a meeting and in a general way about the impact it had on me. A real reminder of what it is like to be a newcomer in fellowship, some completely raw and returning, some completely raw and new. Some with the years and years of wisdom living in recovery. Highlighted was step one, powerless over what has happened, and powerless over alcohol and if I take a drink, then life will get unmanageable again. The self-awareness of other people and their journey into recovery is remarkable, I was not that self-aware, and it took quite a while for me to come to the conclusion that drinking alcohol and any other behaviour which became addictive had made life very very difficult over the years. Life is still difficult, and if I accept that life is difficult and then it is no longer an issue, just for today. Principles which are timeless keep me on track and when I cannot understand what to do, I can ask for help and most often help comes my way. Living a life with humility, opens the door to unknown treasures one day at a time...

For example: I've had a sleepless night, only a couple of hours of sleep or less, my head is churning with all the things I am worried about. Deadlines, what people think of me, I'm short of money, where did my romance go, why does it always happen to me? I haven't got time to put recovery into practice right now.

I don't speak on behalf of Alcoholics Anonymous or you if you are in fellowship, I share of fellowship helps me keep sober one day at a time. I went to AA because I needed to stop drinking. I had no money, and it was free. They told me that AA has one purpose, sobriety. At the same time, people in fellowship needed to be free to be part of anything outside it. Outside of AA, you can be in a sect, your own denomination, keep your politics, belong to any organisation or institution, you can be controversial, you can endorse or oppose causes. All that AA is there to do, is help people stay sober and help others find sobriety. I found AA is about emotional and spiritual well-being and dealing with the good, bad and the ugly of life. And learning the freedom to make my own choices back on a daily basis. Some people believe in God, some are atheists and some are agnostics. I find people are learning to live to the truth and reality of today and cope with it. And if we cannot cope, we find the right people with experience, strength and hope inside or outside fellowship to ask for help. Sometimes we get answers, most often we learn the answers as we go along. I needed the help of many people to learn how to be sober today and I now have the freedom to be me one day at a time...

AA is not the only way..."" It would be unhelpful to believe that the principles, the twelve steps and twelve traditions will work for everyone. There are other ways which may suit many other people aiming to be sober and find a life in recovery. Long may it be so! For me fellowship has provided a way to keep sane and living life one day at a time...

The twelve steps and twelve traditions are all about emotional and spiritual well-being. Emotional and spiritual well-being is clear for me as an individual, my feelings working in the moment and I am able to cope with reality with a great deal of help when needed. And step seven is all about humility and learning life one day at a time. I have found no other program or fellowship or continuous process which makes this possible and always helps the new person find their unique path in life...

And step seven is the humility to keep on learning how to have courage to change when needed, faith in what works for you as an individual and sustaining self-esteem and confidence in the most troublesome times when life seems like life is beyond living. Yes we do want to be happy joyous and free, at the same time it is only sustained by being open honest and willing for today and every day. I as an individual am supported whenever I ask for help inside or outside fellowship...

Olympics! I took heart watching the opening ceremonies on TV. A very British and eclectic opening celebrating the Olympians and the history of modern Britain. The hardship, the toil, the inspirational battle and dogged determination and the sacrifice taking millions out of serfdom and industrial slavery where a few are rewarded and the majority get by. Not lost as a message for the Britain of today, still struggling with equality and yet humble enough to keep trying every single day... I was moved, every emotion including anger and resentment, to happy joyful reminders about how life works for anyone and everyone today...

The 2012 Olympics, a celebration of excellence. The drive and ambition, the grit and determination and a powerful routine year after year. Those who strive succeed on the journey and just a few make it to the top by being the best on the day awarded for their prowess. A desire to be as perfect as possible is a reason to celebrate and also a cautionary concern. In the 1990s, for me a decade in the gym, stronger and more powerful in that decade was all part of my addiction as was work and relationships, oh and of course, alcohol, now I am good enough just for today and still celebrate the endeavour of everyone involved...

A friend on a social network commented and is concerned about newcomers being overtaken by unfortunate circumstances around sponsorship and friendship. All of those in fellowship are sensitive on our emotional and spiritual path, learning what we can do and what we cannot do on a daily basis. And part of this learning becomes a way of life. We look for the virtues of life and try to be open, honest and willing and be truthful in our intentions.

Some ways of life will not work anymore. And as individuals, families, communities and societies, we can see that the old ways needed to change. And to anyone in recovery, the old life, fuelled by alcohol and some personal, family, and society values of prejudice, fear, pride and ego would keep people in ignorance. Contempt prior to investigation: sticking to some traditions and beliefs lead to persistent prejudice, bigotry and for any individual, self-destruction...

In recovery, I found it essential to let go some of my old values and beliefs about me and let go self-prejudice and the notion that I was a failure because I was like anybody else self-medicating with alcohol, it led to addiction and self-destruction. Maybe I had to let go quite a few things, society believing the alcoholism is self-inflicted wound. That my father was right, alcohol was a sharpener of the wits, especially before starting a long car journey as a driver, and that drowning your sorrows was the best way forward when I couldn't cope. I continually practice to let go being swamped and drowned in fear, pride and ego. I do prefer asking for help when I need it, courage to change when I need to, developing faith in doing the next right thing and improving my confidence by learning, making mistakes and trying new ways when old ways don't work...

"PBhEXn_O2-Q","Alcoholics Anonymous | December 3  | DonInLondon | Step 12 ""Freedom To Choose""","December 3 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 12 Living Principles Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog: http://oddbook.co ] Today's Daily Reflections: ""practising these principles in all our affairs..."" Romance and finance... Open, honest and willing. Unity, service and recovery. Romance: I am definitely open to a relationship, honestly I am and willing to go to any lengths... If we are compatible, we will live in unity, do plenty of service and live in recovery happily ever after. Finance: open to the idea of working hard, honestly I am. Willing to try out any sort of work. We can work together and share the profit, develop service products and ensure economic recovery is maintained...

There is a dangerous principle, contempt prior to investigation... Apparently Herbert Spencer did not write the original version of this particular quote from history, the original quote was made by William Paley in the eighteenth century. And I'm sure he augmented another quote from an earlier time. So even when we are looking for contemptible truths which we might find unpalatable, there is truth in them somewhere and from someone. And the flat denial of the alcoholic in active addiction that they are an alcoholic of any kind is quite contemptible in the eyes of other people. Go into any bar in any part of the world or any home, and we find contemptible denial about everything and anything. Some things we just cannot accept even when we are on death's door and the Grim Reaper has a scythe to our neck...

I guess the big question for anybody living life today, is what sort of a person are we? And how do we work out who we are, what we stand for and what we are going to do in life. And we cannot make these ideas about life work without having life experience, having some sort of education, and by education and I mean learning from life as well as from teachers in a formal way. And of course religious sources, society sources and moral codes. First question in recovery, do we want to live to these principles in all our affairs? Being, open, honest and willing, without contempt prior to investigation. Living in unity, service and recovery without contempt after we have investigated just how difficult this is going to be? Practice will not make us perfect, we will make progress and sometimes we will be contemptible of the world as the world's contemptible of us...

Progress means we don't have to be a zealot, we don't have to find a code which is going to work for everyone in practice. Principles are like ethics, we have a code of belief which ensures that everyone has opportunity to make personal choices in our democratic vision of life, where we are all equal. And of course we find in practice that there are some greedy buggers about. They may come across as philanthropic and charitable types, of course they can come across that way. At the same time as the rich are giving, who pays most? The answer is always the poorest and powerless ones across our world. I'm glad I cannot change the world, could not solve it, at the same time I have my principles and do my best one day at a time and forgive everything, every day or nothing changes in me or my outlook...

"FfOhfuBy4-4","Alcoholics Anonymous | July 5 | DonInLondon | Step 7 ""Courage To Change""","2014 Full Daily Blog Link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/alcoholics-anonymous-blog-video-july-5.html July 5 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 7 Courage To Change Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.com/ ] Today's AA daily reflection: ""a new direction, not based on willpower..."" Natural instincts turned to extremes of self-will and then addiction where there is no will, simply an ""ism"" and for me alcoholism. Asking for help, humility to keep on learning and changing my attitudes and behaviour where nature intended? Or simply more fitting a normal way of life with freedom to choose and make good choices today...

Living in a society where a lot of people self medicate, are encouraged to fix their feelings with a drink, I felt right at home in a drinking nation. Unfair on those who never drank and only drink now and again to suggest we have a drinking culture. At the same time I dug into fixing my feelings, continually driving myself to succeed and fit in and fix myself. I don't need to do that anymore and can change direction to the good of living whatever it may be just for today...

In all life activities, if we overdo one element or several elements and take drive and ambition to the very extremes, there will be extreme competence in some elements of living and complete incompetence in others. I don't want to be a ""one trick pony"" and only able to value myself in one way or be valued in one way. We all have a part to play in many aspects of life today starting with learning daily how to love, be able to love back and useful as life offers one day at a time...

A new direction on a daily basis! Not struggling to prove I can do something, simply being able to learn to do anything which is open to me on a daily basis. Narrowing down the choices based on my own ideas and outlook is going to limit my choices. When I ask for help, consult and involve, more ideas and opportunities flourish and choices are more abundant. Just because I can do something, does not mean I should be doing that something today or any day. It's okay to say no and ""I don't feel like it"" when it is a matter of choice. On other matters there are no choices, some needs have to be met based on reality today, but as Gandhi said, ""an emphatic no is better than a half-hearted yes"" when we do have choices in the moment of now...

Step 7 ""Step 7  Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings"" ""The way we have come to look at humility is that it is a virtue, one of the principles that AA teaches us to live. The definition we have adopted pictures us as standing naked before God, without 

pretense nor reservation. It means hiding nothing, being our real selves, both good and bad.  A good synonym for humility is honesty."" BB Bunch

I do not speak for Alcoholics Anonymous I speak for myself. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of unique and authentic people who speak for themselves where they will to share experience, strength and hope about recovery on a daily basis. Anonymity affords 

sanctuary to find how to live sober and be open, honest and willing to learn life day by day. For me ""truth,"" ""love"" and ""wisdom"" offer the best spiritual experience by living reality today. Into the fabric of recovery from alcoholism are woven the Twelve Steps and the 

Twelve Traditions, steps to be open, honest and willing to learn, traditions to live unity, service and recovery.

I can still be driven into old thinking and old insanity by daily events... Not so for this day!

Learning day by day what it is to be an emotional and spiritual being, living in the present moment is difficult. And there are no guarantees what we will face today. The olden days, where life got very predictable and very mad, were manufactured by drinking over and over again, and hoping that the result would be different. Wherever we cross the line with drink, and we do not face reality without drink, the reality of drink and living in the problem is insanity for me. Life is still real when we are drunk, we are just blinkered and doped so we can't see it. Being blinkered and doped and missing the beauty of now, and also the ugly of now, means we do not make progress, we simply swerve the obvious, the truth of our oblivion and our inability to cope...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

I was listening to a documentary about survivors of cancer. Once they have the ""all clear"" they are discharged and given a set of recommendations. And the overwhelming news from the survivors: ""people don't understand what we've been through, they don't realise that being cured, or at least in remission, life was changed forever. And we don't know how to live it."" But like all professionals in any field which saves lives, resources are limited and discharge does not mean that people are equipped to deal with life after the life-saving intervention. I have enormous gratitude that two people sat together and worked out that survivors with like experiences might be able to develop a way to learn how to live life and keep safe in recovery one day at a time...

My name is Don and I'm an alcoholic in recovery... Where was my higher power, what was I doing to avoid the higher power all those years? And would it have turned out different with a higher power? Ignorance is not bliss, if I had known where I would end up. Could I have stopped the inevitable? With my old beliefs, standing on my own two feet, hiding my feelings and heartbreak, putting on a brave face and thinking it was all my fault when things went wrong. On my own, with my own voice in my head trying to make things right ended up making everything go wrong. I thought it was down to me, and feared asking for help as a weakness and not the strength it became in recovery...

Taking responsibility for everything, trying to make life perfect, and hoping it would be all right when I got ""there,"" and never sure where ""there"" was, I missed the point completely. At work or at play, I could be ""the man"" and strive and strive and strive. I became an expert chameleon, changing the outside and trying to fit in and successfully pretending to be the person I thought you wanted me to be. Inside I never recognised loneliness because I had always been lonely. And all the relationships very intimate and beautiful all came crashing down, I preferred loneliness. Even though I didn't recognise it, loneliness, had always been my true companion. And then the companion to rock bottom was alcohol. Alcohol for a while was my higher power, solved the problem of loneliness, and heartbreak over and over again...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

"-46zDGZcTDA","Ivan L. Cocaine Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-02-17T16:34:59.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)']","0","559","0","2","4"

In my case, the living amend is to oneself, stop the blame, stop the guilt and shame and then forgive everything, every day. If we can understand our new direction, to be open, honest and willing, then we stop the blame game. And if we stop the blame game with ourselves and find forgiveness, then we can stop the blame game with everyone else and start to live life on life's terms...

Step four: it may seem like a giant project if it is not broken down. My way of breaking down the fearless moral inventory was to divided up into five-year chunks, simply because I was quite old when I got to step four and when I stopped drinking. In each five-year chunk, there was plenty to be angry and resentful about. State of the nation, the state of my bank balance, the state of my romantic interludes, the state of my career, the fact that drink was always a recipe to take the edge off and fix my feelings, even though I did not realise I was truly fixing my feelings because they were so raw and unhappy with reality...

How natural that was, since most alcoholics are bankrupt idealists. . .So why shouldn't we share our way of life with everyone? [12&12]
The great discovery of sobriety led me to feel the need to spread the ""good news"" to the world around me. The grandiose thoughts of my drinking days returned. Later, I learned that concentrating on my own recovery was a full-time process. As I became a sober citizen in this world, I observed a rippling effect which, without any conscious effort on my part, reached any ""related facility or outside enterprise,"" without diverting me from my primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

Sharing experience, strength and hope by whatever means to help another person keep sober really does help me as an individual live to the principles of the twelve steps and twelve traditions. Even with social media, it is one individual talking to another individual or simply sharing through words, one day at a time...

Sometimes we simply share about life being horrible, it feels like another rock bottom, and if it feels like a rock bottom it is another rock bottom. And when we share that the joy of recovery, when we feel that life is wonderful right now, if it feels wonderful, it is wonderful. Sometimes we do things and hurt people and it feels horrible. And if it feels horrible to hurt people, it is horrible. Feelings are very real and in the moment when we keep on learning the truth in the moment of now...

Giving what? Experience, strength and hope... We share truth as it is right now. And sometimes we share opinion about what is good for us and other people will reject it is completely wrong for them. This is in my humble opinion wonderful. If I came to fellowship and continued to come to fellowship and heard nothing new and heard the same old same old, either my listening is faulty or I can only hear my story. I need new stories, and real truth and I get it one day at a time and I grow a little bit today...

Our daily reprieve! To hear the truth, to hear opinion, to hear about the misunderstandings of life. To hear about the joy of new living, to hear about a person evolving out of self obsessed outlooks where self harm and self prejudice were killing us. And to hear about the freedom of choice we get in recovery. Step one and being powerless when indulging in an addiction, to every step opening up the world so we may be a part of it and make free choices based on reality today...

Sometimes when we get a message, when someone says they have something to tell us and they don't give an inkling what it might be about, it can kick off all the old defects right down to the very last thing we may still have kept a secret. And then I try to rack my brains to find out in my own head if I kept a secret about anything in my past. I don't need other people to gossip about me to feel fear indeed I don't feel fear about gossip out there, it is usually the chattering gossip in my head from those who reside in it. Indeed the critic in my head, can be my own worst enemy or frenemey! I have not heard the chattering chorus of critique inside my head for quite a while because I keep near to fellowship and fellowship people every single day...

Step 8 ""Step Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all."" ""n other words, who have you harmed? You will recall from our discussion of Steps 4 and 5, that a preliminary list of persons we had harmed is generated there. 

The list will now be refined into a personal amendment plan, which is the product of Step 8.""Although this step requires plenty of work, there is nothing frightening in it. Amends are not actually made in Step 8. Instead, we plan for the making of amends in Step 9, 

which follows. Harm is: injury, hurt, damage, misfortune, grief, pain, sorrow, evil, wrong or wickedness. Have we brought about any of these in the lives of others? The Big Book and the 12&12 also are quite specific about harm."" BB Bunch

What is tolerance and love mean to me? Sometimes I sum it up like this, ""I love you, and at the same time, I hate your behaviour!"" Inside fellowship, or outside fellowship, we can love people and really detest their behaviour. And similarly, I don't want you to agree with me for the sake of a peaceful life, I need you to thoroughly follow your own path in sobriety, or I am doomed as well...

Fellowship is a place of safety, anonymity, providing a sanctuary to find out how to live life sober, open, willing and honest to seek out the truth, love and wisdom in the moment of now. We can be attracted to bright shiny stories, of romance and finance and where wealth leads to excess and excess leads to addiction. And sometimes people mistake self-esteem for ego, self-esteem where growing confidence helps find the truth, and ego makes the truth unmanageable and a wallow in the mud and murk of old glories. Sometimes people do geographical moves to find peace, fall in and out of relationships, hoping to be saved, and sometimes see the weakness in another and prey on them, and it is all part of learning life in the moment of now...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

I never wanted to join anything in my life, I liked to be on the outside and I liked to be included, just enough to understand why I didn't want to join in. Our fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, not an organisation, not an institution. And certainly for many a year, it was the last place I would ever go. And when I learned that I could not quit drink on my own, I was surprised to find that the fellowship of AA is always what you see today, what you see is what you get, today it is always a mixture of good, bad and ugly experiences shared as the truth comes out. I was lucky, I realised I had finally found a place of sanctuary where I could find out the truth of me, and I only find out the truth of me on a daily basis...

I found I could join a fellowship which had no rules or regulations and no laws to violate and was based on one principal: ""love."" Emotional and spiritual, love is the absolute foundation of living and I found people in the fellowship of AA, who were all about love. How people express love, how people help each other and how it works with raw people is profound. In the last chance saloon, love seems to be the only currency which works one day at a time. On arrival, the initiation process into the fellowship was a complete let-down based on my old ideas: I turned up and nobody bothered me, that was because I didn't speak. I went to another meeting, and had to say my name or so I thought and I said, ""my name is Don and I am an alcoholic,"" and everyone in the meeting, said, ""hello Don."" I also said I had been to one or two meetings, and still had no clue what it was all about. And people shook my hand and said don't worry, it will be all right, just try to keep coming back...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

I work at living one day at a time. A meeting yesterday, a beautiful share about tradition one, ""our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA Unity."" Fellowship means a great deal to me, because it is based on emotional and spiritual well-being with a toolkit of twelve steps which help me find my way, one day at a time. It can be easy to misunderstand the first tradition because it emphasises unity and common welfare, without the other bit, the bit which kept me in fellowship, ""no AA can compel another to do anything: nobody can be punished or expelled."" Emotional and spiritual, learning to live life with freedom as an individual, and at the same time developing knowledge of how unity, service and recovery work in parallel with the twelve steps... This whole thing, twelve steps for personal well-being and how to grow and change as life changes, twelve traditions which are suggestions and not laws ever! Ensuring we have enough unity, service and recovery, embedded, just for today... [continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

To me a huge part of addiction is a battle of control.
I found that I could not control myself so I was hell bent on controlling others.   Then as that never works it would be back to the addiction again as I was depressed, frustrated and beat.

Does this make sense to anyone?

Have a blessed day,

This video maybe a little controversial but it was inspired from a post and comment thread in a support group I am a member of.

Everyone's recovery is personal and what works for one does not make sense to another.  Please just take what works and leave the rest.  Never be scared away from recovery because you are not able to do it as someone else does.

Stay happy and sober my friends

"YLAbBVkFMfo","Alcoholics Anonymous | May 31 | DonInLondon | Step 5 ""Share Your Truth""","May 31 | Alcoholics Anonymous Daily Video |

Love Truth - Love People... Truth is timeless, stuck in old attitudes and behaviour, truth is elusive. As we open up and see people, places and life as it is now... As our earth revolves around a sun, the sun a star, a star in an infinite universe, truth and love changes everything in the moment...

""Honesty becomes part of our ""tool kit"" to free us from our past... Included, we learn to share and express, courage to be vulnerable. As a consequence we let go old fears of shame and guilt... Listening and not judging our fellows, open and willing we can change and find freedom today.

AA Daily Reflections ~ ""READINESS TO SERVE OTHERS... our Society has concluded that it has but one high mission — to carry the A.A. message to those who don't know there's a way out. TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 151

The ""Light"" to freedom shines bright on my fellow alcoholics as each one of us challenges the other to grow. The ""Steps"" to self-improvement have small beginnings, but each Step builds the ""ladder"" out of the pit of despair to new hope. Honesty becomes my ""tool"" to unfurl the ""chains"" which bound me. A sponsor, who is a caring listener, can help me to truly hear the message guiding me to freedom. I ask God for the courage to live in such a way that the Fellowship may be a testimony to His favor. This mission frees me to share my gifts of wellness through a spirit of readiness to serve others.""


""The A.A. Steps & Traditions are neither rules, regulations, nor laws. Perhaps the secret of their power lies in the fact that these life-giving communications spring out of living experience and are rooted in love."" 1. A.A. COMES OF AGE, P. 105.""  ""We find it amazing that the newcomer can start the A.A. program without any specific beliefs or, for that matter, without any beliefs whatsoever. All a person needs is the open-mindedness and the willingness to believe that WE BELIEVE this program works...""

Spiritual principles to live life ""real"" ~ ""Forgiveness"" ""Acceptance"" ""Surrender"" ""Faith"" ""Open-mindedness"" ""Honesty"" ""Willingness"" ""Moral-inventory"" ""Amends"" ""Humility"" ""Persistence"" ""Spiritual-growth"" ""Service""

Without them we wouldn't be complete human beings."" First sentences in the twelve and twelve. Natural instincts hardwired into our consciousness, our brain. We have five senses, hardwired to provide instant information. Without these hardwired instincts, we would not be human beings. And for whatever reason, when our instincts are out of balance, our desires for something or someone, probably imbalanced because they do not fit societies codes and morals... The fearless moral inventory highlights where we may be out of step with common codes of behaviour which have been established for generations...

On Saturday, a friend suggested I might be going out with my camera to take photos and they were right, I felt like getting out. I absolutely love taking photographs of people, places and things because I love to see the truth of now. The season is changing and the mood of people is changing. The way places look in the spring, and all sorts of things come to life at this time of year. I feel it and have a desire to be out there. Saturday, still cold and the mood outside in the world seemed depressed. And then out on Sunday, sunshine and warmth, warming people, warming up places, and things are happening. My natural feelings to be in the world and observing and taking part. And seeing the truth of now. I feel attracted to the warmth of the world, the warmth of people, places and things coming alive at last, after a long winter. I am of nature and I love nature and I love people. From the glamorous girl posing for a film crew, to the drunken man shouting on the steps of Saint Martin's in the fields about the world coming to an end, I see it and feel it in the moment of now...

What is normal? The whole world seems to be enamoured with striving to be number one, and to prove prowess in some way or other. 2012 saw the Olympics in the UK, and the nation into the success of athletes who have spent their lives becoming the best at one element of life. What about the rest of their lives? When we cannot do the things we are best at, have been taught and trained to do, and that element of life is taken away for whatever reason, the traumatic impact of change can unhinge anyone...

I was very lucky to be stopped in my tracks, becoming more and more able to do just one thing, to be a specialist cog in a multinational, to be the best eclectic counsellor you might ever encounter on the planet, and certainly in my imagination back then. I could not see how good I had become at helping and advising others, until I could do it no more. And although I might have been a good counsellor, the cost of being that good was killing me. And I reckon I wasn't that good, I could not see myself and the impact of life on me. Old attitudes and behaviour, and very bad habits paid for by excellence in the field of work I'd never planned and only undertaken because I was asked. And I never knew how to say no to the job or the money and never really thought about the consequences... Hindsight is very helpful as long as we do not wallow and think we ought to be back where we were before, even though it might be convenient for many around us...

When we are looking to find a way out of our malady, how incomprehensible addiction to alcohol, substances, particular people, particular places and doing particular things, it all starts with a habit. The habit of fixing our feelings so that we can cope in the moment of now. Unfortunately the moment of now, when we have fixed ourselves in some way with a substance or behaviour, cannot be maintained and the more we try, the more we try fix with the excesses, the less the effect and the less the impact and the more we try to keep on fixing, it seems logical, and then becomes a madness we cannot stop...

The Advice Everyone Needs To Know About Drug addiction

Drug addiction can affect all kinds of people for example, postpartum drug addiction affects new mothers. Some moms aren't as happy as you'd think after having a kid. This is due to a different level of hormones racing through the body. This article will help you understand the symptoms of drug addiction.

Treat blue moods and drug addiction by avoiding all types of sugar, including """"healthy"""" sugars such as fruit juice, honey or molasses. This kind of sugar enters the bloodstream more rapidly than the more complex versions of carbohydrates, like whole grains. This will result in an initial energy burst followed by a crash of fatigue and drug addiction.

Don't neglect your social outlets. Drug addiction may keep you from wanting to do your normal activities. You will have to make a few efforts to be socially active. Keep up with the things that you would normally do. When you neglect what you should normally be doing, you can sometimes get discouraged and more addicted.

Antidepressants are a good way to rectify the imbalance of your brain's neurochemicals. A physical fitness plan, and attention to nutrition by you to be as healthy as possible, that is one part of the complete therapy plan because it also requires meeting with a therapist.

Do not use the words """"drug addiction"""" or """"addicted"""" in your vocabulary. Although useful in the clinical world, these words often work against you with a self-fulfilling prophesy, or otherwise just bring you down. Rather, when in the grip of drug addiction, try to classify it as nothing more than a bad mood. Although you are still battling drug addiction, changing your mood level puts your feelings into a new perspective.

Find someone you care about that you can hang out with, play video games with or go out to eat with. Getting out and enjoying a relaxing social event may improve your mood.

Feeling sad because of a traumatic life event may not be a case of clinical drug addiction. Talk to a therapist so he can diagnose what you are afflicted with! 

You can ward off drug addiction by listening to and playing music. This is true for any art. No matter your skill level, they can help you through tough times.

Keeping beautiful flowers around can help perk you up. Flowers, with their beautiful colors and heavenly scents, have evolved over millions of years to attract different species, including humans. Remember this, and attempt to set out or view fresh flowers every day.

Alcohol Rehab Baltimore Recovery From Alcoholism Baltimore  MD

If your physician gives you antidepressants for treating drug addiction, you need to take them as prescribed. Don't take less or more than what you're supposed to be taking, and don't stop the medication without talking with the doctor because it could be dangerous for you. You may find horrible side effects if you mess around with your treatment.

Online support groups and forums can be great for drug addiction sufferers. These groups are anonymous and may help you feel more confident about opening up and exploring the causes of your drug addiction. There are many groups out there for this specific purpose.

Try to understand your drug addiction. Drug addiction is not only mental, but it is physical too. The reduction of serotonin in the brain is a common result of prolonged feelings of stress and anxiety. This is often a contributing factor in drug addiction. Anti-depressants encourage serotonin production in the brain, and for this reason are prescribed for those with drug addiction. You can naturally increase seratonin levels rather than depending on anti-depressant drugs to restore them to the levels you need. Minimize your use of caffeine and alcohol, be sure to get plenty of sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a proper diet.

Drug addiction can affect everyone, even mothers. Many people neglect to realize they have drug addiction. But, it is a condition that needs to be treated. This article should have given you some advice on how to cope if you have drug addiction.

Boredom is an agitated mind trying to find something to do. Everything is working at 100% in the moment of now, you may not be aware of it, even when you think you are idle, your feelings are working, your thinking is working and physically even at rest, your body is working automatically...

Active and living in the fatal malady, life is crowded, we don't recognise the mood we are in, and our thinking is shaped by our drinking. And physically, we are impaired and unable to function, and keep in the moment of now. On every level, we are not functioning in the moment of now, because we are hardly present and able to function at all. If we are not thinking about the next drink or the next fix, our emotions and mood is agitated, and physically, the body craves something missing. Still working at a hundred percent of capacity, the mind and the body are continually distracted by the need to fix something elusive. I desperately sought peace of mind and a way to shut off from everything, usually work and the fix was a diversion into oblivion, for as long as possible one day at a time...

In some way or other, back in the old life, all our faculties, emotions and senses, thinking and projecting into a fantasy, and physically disabled, our bodies don't work overtime, they try to cope with the stresses and the impact our fix has from moment to moment. There is no rest in active addiction, simply oblivion and exhaustion as the fatal malady runs its course. We don't evade, or stop the progression and exhaustion caused by drink and fixing. All this energy, having to cope with the extra stress, something is not happening naturally any more, finding a resting place, where energy is utilised to restore the body and the mind, the energy in fixing, and the mind and body, not able to cope with reality...

In my career I worked with a lot of very damaged people, and many of them had drinking problems, and drug taking problems. In their opinion, there was not enough drink and there were not enough drugs to solve their problems. I would often help them find ways to resolve their problems and they stopped drinking and taking drugs. And I never looked at me, going home to take the edge off and push their problems out of my head with alcohol. We don't know we are an alcoholic until we get there because it's always them and never me...

Step one, powerless and unmanageable living: Even when we realise there is something wrong, denial and always tomorrow to resolve the issue kept me drinking because it was important to see through to the end of the day. Step two, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. And that is the madness; I will sort it out tomorrow and tomorrow never comes. By the time we admit and accept our problem, we are at rock bottom. No wonder sobriety is one of the most difficult journeys into recovery from addiction.

And even in the early days of recovery, I hoped after a few months there would be an inner sanctum, where I would graduate and become immune to addiction. The graduation would be celebrated with a drink, a cigarette, a good time and girls adoring me. The pipedream probably kept me going for a while and then reality bit hard. I got my through the pipedream and found reality, with freedom to choose and learn life. No need to dream or fix my life away... The girls would have been very welcome though...

And why can I be part of the higher power solution for other people?"" So often we think we know the answers, and we know what the solutions ought to be. And we find that the rest of the world is not cooperating and does not understand how reasonable we are in our demands... And why can I help other people and find it so difficult to help myself?

A lot of the time, we have life experience which leads us to expectations and conclusions based on all the things that have happened in the past. Recovery is about breaking the old patterns, the old expectations and the old resentments coming back to haunt us. Dealing with human beings needs to start with humility, equality and how to access their power to help with the issues we face. If we demand, we shut down our options to the demand. We make life impossible for ourselves, and we make life impossible for those from whom we seek help and support. ""Can you help me please?"" Rather than, ""I need you to help me, I want you to help me, and declaring a need and want is not asking it is telling someone. When we are telling people things that they need or should do for us, we take away their power and most likely create resentment in them about our wants and needs...

Our ego demands and says we are entitled, ""fix me now!"" And hopefully we start to learn that humility asks without expectation, ""can you help me please?"" The old way of life; when our best friend, alcohol would fix anything and everything, putting the world to rights from the bottom of the glass. The new way of living; with nothing in-between me and the reality of today, and being able to cope in the moment of now. And if I'm not coping, I can always ask for help today...

What is the purpose of this wonderful fellowship called Alcoholics Anonymous? Its primary purpose is to help anyone with a desire to stop drinking, understand that sober we have a chance to live life on life's terms. And then the big one in fellowship is the tradition of unity, service and recovery being the three legacies. Getting my personal freedom back by being in a fellowship which is all about working together, helping others and everyone living in recovery just for one day. What we encounter in fellowship today, is as good as it gets, or as some say, ""WYSIWYG: what you see is what you get."" Sometimes, what we see can be very good and very helpful, very bad and very helpful, and very ugly and very helpful. We don't fix ourselves in recovery, we learn the solutions to our problems on a daily basis. Together in unity, service and recovery...

When I got my freedom back, to make the choices which were right for me on a daily basis, I was going to be influenced by many people who share their experience, strength and hope on a daily basis. Listening to the wisdom of others is fantastic, sometimes what I hear works not only for them in recovery, it gives me ideas and opportunities to try out new ways of living based on what others have found works for them. I don't feel like there is anything original to be said by anyone, anywhere, because it's already been said somewhere by someone else. At the same time, I have not heard it before, I have not heard it said like that before, and I didn't realise the wisdom might apply to my life. When I stop judging what other people are doing, and looking for the holes or get out clauses, I started to hear the whole story, and then be able to adapt many suggestions into my way of life. If there had been no personal freedom to be gained, if I had not got my personal choices back by being sober, I would have perished a long time ago...

"opm8nx_zL60","Jim W. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

Al-Anon / Alateen, known as Al-Anon Family Groups, is an international ""fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength, and hope in order to solve their common problems.""They ""help families of alcoholics by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic.""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""After a while I began to wonder why I was not as happy as I ought to be, since the one thing I had been yearning for all my married life [Bill's sobriety] had come to pass. Then one Sunday, Bill asked me if I was ready to go to the meeting with him. To my own astonishment as well as his, I burst forth with ""Damn your old meetings!"" and threw a shoe as hard as I could.

This surprising display of temper over nothing pulled me up short and made me start to analyze my own attitudes. ... My life's purpose of sobering up Bill, which had made me feel desperately needed, had vanished. ... I decided to strive for my own spiritual growth. I used the same principles as he did to learn how to change my attitudes. ... We began to learn that ... the partner of the alcoholic also needed to live by a spiritual program."" — ""Lois's Story"" in How Al-Anon Works

In the space of two years, he lost his job, his house, and his family. When he finally faced the damaged he had caused in his life and the lives of those he loved, he wondered if there was any hope for the future. Because God helped him make amends, there was.

Step 9 - Wherever possible, make direct restitution to all persons you have harmed.

Brookside Institute offers treatment protocol that combines the latest in neuroscience (TMS Neurofeedback), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medicine to treat addiction and co-occurring disorders (dual diagnosis).

Unlike other treatment centers that may offer ""non 12 step programs"" the Brookside Recovery Protocol ™ is a science-based, medical model that applies over twenty years of scientific research to provide a comprehensive treatment for addiction. Although other treatment programs may claim to be non 12 step, none provide the same level of care and innovative approach to addiction as Brooksides individualized, all-inclusive treatment protocol. Many programs have recently jumped on the non 12 step trend; however, Brookside Institute is the pioneer in science-based, medical model treatment for addiction and has always used this model to treat addiction.

At the Neuroscience Center we use TMS and Neurofeedback as treatment.

Magno-EEG Resonant Therapy (MERT) is an innovative treatment procedure using a noninvasive electromagnetic resonant process to tune up or down specific brainwaves. This is a refined process of the traditional Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) that is unique to Brookside Institute NeuroScience Center. Unlike TMS, MERT is precisely calculated based on the individuals electroencephalography (EEG) to deliver the perfect combination of electromagnetic resonance to bring the brainwave back into balance.

The MERT process begins with a baseline EEG recording to characterize the patients individual brainwave signature. The signature is then used to determine the MERT treatment settings, which include output intensity, stimulus frequency, location, duration and maintenance plan to bring the brainwaves back into normal patterns.

As a second treatment option, Neurofeedback is a revolutionary non-invasive procedure that can improve symptoms of a variety of behavioral disorders, learning disabilities and mental illness. It is a form of biofeedback that presents a patients brainwave activity in real time using a video display technique that allows the patient to learn how to control and change his or her brainwaves to healthier patterns or function. Through several sessions, the patient learns to control objects on the monitor, in essence using his or her mind to play a video game. As the patients brain function improves, the difficulty of the game is increased.

The neurofeedback procedure at Brookside Institute begins by assessing the brain activity, using EEG recorded brainwaves, or brain signals, as it relates to abilities to learn, concentrate and control emotions. This comprehensive analysis is used as a guide to re-train specific areas of the brain using exercises that target the identified brain areas that are compromised.

While we want you to select us because the Brookside Recovery Protocol offers the only science-based, medical model for addiction treatment, we also want our clients to be comfortable and enjoy the surroundings and the climate of Southern California; which can't be beat.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-12-12T00:06:20.000Z","[u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Sexaholics Anonymous', u'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous', u'Gamblers Anonymous', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'Marijuana Anonymous', u'Celebrate Recovery', u'Higher Power', u'God', u'Addiction', u'Recovery', u'12 Step Recovery', u'Speaker', u'NA', u'AA', u'CA', u'OA', u'GA', u'12 step program', u'12 steps', u'Methamphetamine', u'Opiates', u'Marijuana', u'Heroin', u'Abuse', u'Survivors', u'Alcoholism', u'Big Book', u'Basic Text', u'12 and 12', u'Co-dependent', u'Al-Anon']","10","12884","0","6","183"

""After a while I began to wonder why I was not as happy as I ought to be, since the one thing I had been yearning for all my married life [Bill's sobriety] had come to pass. Then one Sunday, Bill asked me if I was ready to go to the meeting with him. To my own astonishment as well as his, I burst forth with ""Damn your old meetings!"" and threw a shoe as hard as I could.

This surprising display of temper over nothing pulled me up short and made me start to analyze my own attitudes. ... My life's purpose of sobering up Bill, which had made me feel desperately needed, had vanished. ... I decided to strive for my own spiritual growth. I used the same principles as he did to learn how to change my attitudes. ... We began to learn that ... the partner of the alcoholic also needed to live by a spiritual program."" — ""Lois's Story"" in How Al-Anon Works

You can overcome addictions, depression, anxiety.

Scientific discoveries in biology and neuroscience have provided new data that show that it is possible to change our genetic expression, create new neural networks and grow new brain neurons throughout our lifetime.  This is a huge revolutionary, or more to the point, evolutionary, paradigm shift in our understanding of how our bodies and minds can heal.  This presentation will discuss the sciences of Epigenetics, Energy Psychology, Neuroplasticity and Neurogenesis and their impact on addiction treatment.  This discussion will provide a brief overview of Radical Transformation® an efficient and effective holistic 4-Step Program to aid people in recovery from addiction, codependency, and other self-destructive behaviors. It is now substantiated by science that the mind, body, and spirit are all interconnected, thus the possibility of complete and sustainable recovery is significantly increased when your entire being is treated, not just one part of yourself.  Therefore if a client has symptoms manifesting in the mind, there must be a related imbalance in the physical body and/or energetic body.  Radical Transformation® directly addresses the mind, body, spirit connection with a specific protocol that deals with each of these aspects.

History of Addiction Treatment and Recovery in America

Thank you !!


Reflections - Ernie Kurtz - Introduction

Reflections - Ernie Kurtz - Chapter 2: Spirituality

Reflections - Ernie Kurtz - Chapter 3: Shame & Mentoring


The Collected Ernie Kurtz  - http://hindsfoot.org/ktcek1.html




Ernest Kurtz has been the outstanding thinker of the A.A. tradition's second generation, the one who played a constant leadership role in pushing the movement towards the highest professional standards of history writing and supplied some of its most influential interpretive concepts. 

His ideas are vitally important for anyone who wishes to understand A.A. history during the period following Bill Wilson's death in 1971.

As a Ph.D. student at Harvard University in the 1970's, he was the first researcher to be granted full access to the archives of Alcoholics Anonymous. The book that resulted, 

Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous (1979), is still the classic work on early A.A. history. 

His book on the spiritual life -- Ernest Kurtz and Katherine Ketcham, The Spirituality of Imperfection: Modern Wisdom from Classic Stories (1992) 

-- is equally well known, and has also been an enduring best seller through the years since it appeared. His work on Shame & Guilt (orig. pub. 1981, rev. ed. 2007) has given a whole new depth to the discussion of those two vital recovery issues.

There are millions of us who are in recovery that remain unknown to most of their friends and co-workers. Maybe we should declare ourselves to bring hope to those who are still struggling.
""Deeply entrenched social stigma and mass participation in widely successful anonymous 12-step groups have kept recovery voices silent and faces hidden for decades."" But now, many recovery advocates are beginning to ""come out of the shadows to tell their true stories."" The powerful message of The Anonymous People is conveyed through the faces and voices of the leaders, volunteers, corporate executives and celebrities who are ""coming out"" in order to publicize the epidemic of addiction—and to help other addicts break their silence. This new public recovery movement aims to transform public opinion, change public dialogue around addiction and recovery, and unite the recovery community as a political force.

Some recovery treatment centers do not use sufficient evidence-backed methods, while some use many and holistic approaches to treatment. You can learn more about this on the website. 



According to researchers from Case Western Reserve University, helping the community in various service opportunities has shown to increase sobriety of addicts.

Website: http://truthofaddiction.com/special/

Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialTruthOfAddiction

“The research indicates that getting active in service helps alcoholics and other addicts become sober and stay sober, and suggests this approach is applicable to all treatment-seeking individuals with a desire to not drink or use drugs.” (Maria E. Pagano PhD. / School of Medicine).

Researchers have called this the “helping therapy principle” (HTP) and has been in practice at AA to diminish egocentrism. These findings suggest that when an addict finds opportunities to help someone, they actually help themselves.

According to this study, 40 percent of alcoholics who helped other alcoholics were able to avoid drinking during recovery, whereas only 22 percent of those that did not help others, were able to stay sober.

This goes beyond addiction. Individuals with mental and physical health conditions such as body dysmorphic disorder, AIDS or chronic pain also show an improvement from serving others.

Addicts in recovery often find long-term success in “quitting” when they seek something else, something beyond themselves. Addicts may initially just want to become “sober,” but eventually find merit in living an honest life. Addicts are often lying and hiding their behavior from those they love and have a great deal of paranoia and stigma. Living an honest life is usually very attractive to an addict.

Alcoholics anonymous and addiction recovery programs often help one to engage in service which takes the mind off of oneself. Drug and alcohol treatment centers and recovery treatment centers are beneficial when they use these and other techniques.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

Alcoholics Anonymous - Guided Meditation 

(Step 11, Sought through prayer and meditation...)


Step 11  

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood God, praying only for knowledge of God's will for us and the power to carry that out


Step 11 suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn't be shy in this matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly. It works, if we have the proper attitude and work at it.
-A.A. Big Book p.85-86 





The following summarizes the description of the 11th Step provided in Alcoholics Anonymous (primarily on pp. 86-88). This is supplemented by some suggestions [in brackets] that we have found helpful.

Preparing for the Day Ahead

1. We ask God to direct our thinking, asking especially that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives.

2. We consider our plans for the day. We can now use our mental faculties with assurance.

3. If we face indecision or we can't determine what course to take, we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy.

4. We pray to be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to take care of problems.

5. We ask especially for freedom from self-will.

[We might also pray for help with specific defects or problem areas, and review our 10th step corrective measures for the day ahead.]

Prayers to be of Use

6. We ask for guidance in the way of patience, kindness, tolerance and love especially within the family.

7. We pray as to what we can do today for the person who is still sick.

[We might also pray for specific people in need, or those with whom we're angry.]

Spiritual/Religious Exercises

8. If appropriate, we attend to our religious devotions, or say set prayers which emphasize 12 Step principles.

9. We may read from a spiritual book.

Practicing the 11th Step Throughout the Day

10. We pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action.

11. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times each day ""Thy will be done.""

This is the first video for the chapter ""The Doctor's Opinion"" of the Alcoholics Anonymous - AA Big Book - 1st Step. 

Book Basic Training is a 10 hour video series that carefully walks the viewer through the first 172 pages of the AA Big Book ""Alcoholics Anonymous"". Colorful video illustrations help breakdown and clarify hundreds of the AA Big Book's sequential concepts and principals.

Using the drop-down menu (see website http://www.rellennium.com/) the user can access any Step (or any topic within a Step) from the AA Big Book within seconds. No having to guess page numbers. Simply tap the icon for a step, choose the starting point within the chapter, and tap the icon and the video starts playing (in sequence): reading, underlining and explaining from that chosen point in the AA Big Book.
As the viewer is literally walked through the AA Big Book one-paragraph-at-a-time (skipping nothing!) the videos also simultaneously guide the viewer as they take all 12 Steps using the 170 page fill-in-the-blanks ""Big Book Basic Training Workbook"". Instructions for working all 12 steps in the workbook are demonstrated and illustrated clearly and completely in the videos.
Whether you have a loved one struggling with alcoholism or addiction or you are a member of a 12 Step program looking for an infinitely easier, more thorough and effective way to work and teach the 12 Steps - this product is for you! For those who have completed the 12 Steps and had a spiritual experience, use this product to continually work Steps 10 - 12.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

""After a while I began to wonder why I was not as happy as I ought to be, since the one thing I had been yearning for all my married life [Bill's sobriety] had come to pass. Then one Sunday, Bill asked me if I was ready to go to the meeting with him. To my own astonishment as well as his, I burst forth with ""Damn your old meetings!"" and threw a shoe as hard as I could.

This surprising display of temper over nothing pulled me up short and made me start to analyze my own attitudes. ... My life's purpose of sobering up Bill, which had made me feel desperately needed, had vanished. ... I decided to strive for my own spiritual growth. I used the same principles as he did to learn how to change my attitudes. ... We began to learn that ... the partner of the alcoholic also needed to live by a spiritual program."" — ""Lois's Story"" in How Al-Anon Works

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

""One alcoholic talking to another alcoholic!""


Please research the Washingtonian's 1840-1848 failure due too NO singleness of purpose.

The Washingtonian movement (Washingtonians or Washingtonian Total Abstinence Society) was a 19th century fellowship founded on April 2, 1840 by six hard drinkers at Chase's Tavern on Liberty Street in Baltimore, Maryland. 

The idea was that by relying on each other, sharing their alcoholic experiences and relying upon divine help, they could keep each other sober. Total abstinence from alcohol was their goal. The group taught sobriety and preceded Alcoholics Anonymous by 100 years.

Psilocybin-Assisted Treatment for Alcohol Dependence

Michael Bogenschutz, MD

Abstract: This presentation will review past clinical trials of the classic hallucinogens for addiction, discuss possible mechanisms of action, and present the design and preliminary results of an ongoing pilot study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence. Before clinical research with these drugs was halted abruptly in the early 1970s, the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism was studied extensively, with additional studies involving other classic hallucinogens and other addictions. A recent meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials of LSD for treatment of alcoholism (N = 536) demonstrated that the overall effect size of LSD treatment was clinically and statistically significant for up to 6 months after a single high-dose treatment. Candidate mechanisms include: acute objective brain effects, which can be measured at a number of levels; acute subjective effects, including mystical and other highly salient experiences; persisting effects, e.g. on brain structure and function, psychological states such as mood and anxiety, personality traits, beliefs, and values; and final change mechanisms directly related to substance use behavior, such as craving, self-efficacy, and motivation.

Dr. Michael Bogenschutz is Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology and Vice-Chair for Addictions and Clinical Research in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. Dr. Bogenschutz received his BA cum laude from Harvard University in 1985, and his MD cum laude from the joint Harvard/MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program in 1990. He joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico in 1994 after completing his residency in psychiatry at the Cambridge Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. Dr. Bogenschutz has served on many committees and taskforces at the state and national level; has published over 100 articles, chapters, and abstracts; and has served as a reviewer for over a dozen peer-reviewed journals.

"QYmy1iqTrLQ","Cookie S. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

Alateen ""is part of the Al-Anon fellowship designed for the younger relatives and friends of alcoholics through the teen years.""  Al-Anon defines itself as an independent fellowship with the stated purpose of helping relatives and friends of alcoholics.  Al-Anon holds the view that alcoholism is a family illness.

From Wikipedia ""Al-Anon/Alateen, known as Al-Anon Family Groups, is an international ""fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength, and hope in order to solve their common problems.""They ""help families of alcoholics by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic."" 

Al-Anon was formed in 1951 by Anne B. and Lois W., wife of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) co-founder Bill W. They recognized the need for such an organization as family members living with AA members began to identify their own pathologies associated with their family members' alcoholism. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""After a while I began to wonder why I was not as happy as I ought to be, since the one thing I had been yearning for all my married life [Bill's sobriety] had come to pass. Then one Sunday, Bill asked me if I was ready to go to the meeting with him. To my own astonishment as well as his, I burst forth with ""Damn your old meetings!"" and threw a shoe as hard as I could.

This surprising display of temper over nothing pulled me up short and made me start to analyze my own attitudes. ... My life's purpose of sobering up Bill, which had made me feel desperately needed, had vanished. ... I decided to strive for my own spiritual growth. I used the same principles as he did to learn how to change my attitudes. ... We began to learn that ... the partner of the alcoholic also needed to live by a spiritual program.""
— ""Lois's Story"" in How Al-Anon Works

This is the first installment of a Big Book Study done by well known AA members Joe and Charlie.  They start this share by talking about the history of the Big Book and Bill W's writing style, which is key to better understanding the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.  ""Bill W. explains what the problem is, gives a solution to the problem, and gives a practical program of action to implement the solution that he described.""

Before Joe and Charlie even get into the book, they discuss a detailed history of AA, and how the book actually came about.  Later on, they stress the importance and the difference of the program vs. the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous.  They also do a great job of explaining why the success rate of AA has gone from 75% to less than 10%, and offer solutions on how members can increase the success rate of AA once again.  This is an amazing resource for anyone in the program, and provides a truthful and meaningful explanation of the origin of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Big Book.

A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON DOCTOR SILKWOTH

As a young intern at Bellevue Hospital in the year 1900 Doctor Silkworth found he was especially drawn to alcoholics, and that alcoholics were drawn to him.
Over the following decades his personal modesty, disarming gentleness and his profound understanding of the disease helped him secure the trust of his alcoholic patients; a vital component needed when working with alcoholics.
In the early 1930s his decades of tireless hard work finally paved the way for a new era that fused medical AND spiritual healing.
While working with a patient named Bill Wilson at Towns Hospital in New York City they became aware of and began to apply a practical, workable spiritual solution to alcoholism.
Centuries of a world without an answer to alcoholism ended when the blueprint for a spiritual experience or spiritual awakening was discovered and applied simultaneously in New York City and Akron Ohio.
By the time Doctor Silkworth wrote his two letter included in the doctors opinion he had 38 years’ experience working with alcoholics and by this time he had worked with over 40,000 alcoholics.
Please now open your book to The Doctor’s Opinion.
Let’s look at the title of the chapter; The Doctor’s Opinion
The dictionary definition for a MEDICAL opinion is:
“A judgment based on special knowledge and given by an expert: a medical opinion.”
So – when Doctor Silkworth wrote the two letters for this chapter he was providing his professional medical opinion. His medical opinion was not the same as my opinion or your opinion on alcoholism --- it was the opinion of a medical doctor … a doctor with (at that time) 38 years’ experience working with alcoholics.","UCmFMoNv58S-ISvqZ47qz_5g","2014-11-20T18:47:25.000Z","[u'Alcoholics anonymous', u'aa', u'aa big book']","2","502","0","0","4"

Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more...""

Let go the way we used to be? With step one, 100% step we stop drinking alcohol. Simply one day at a time and the same applies when it comes to dealing with our old attitudes and behaviour. Old ways just don't disappear, it is a daily reckoning one way or another how we behave today...

Contingent on the day I ask the help: that is part of my morning daily meditations. I can then watch the news on TV, listen to the radio and hear all the old actions and activities of the great and the good, and the bad and the ugly. I may get churned up by what is happening in the world, and have great opinions about what I would do if I were in charge. And then find serenity understanding the possible and impossible today... Sober, asking for help and included I can play my part in society in the moment of now...

I need to be aware when life feels fearful and there is little evidence. A sense of fear is good, watching out for real events where I am involved in and something may go wrong. That is entirely natural. But when I feel fear and there is no evidence, all those horrible scenarios of the past may grab hold of me. What to do? Ask the help, phone a friend, meditate and pray, find a meeting. Two heads and many heads in fellowship will help me find the truth, just for today...

When I feel wonderful when I wake up and yes this can happen! I might ask why, or I might just go with the feeling. I do consider though, because there can be a rush to judgement, how this feeling may continue. Some gratitude, some caution and checking and I still feel okay, even wonderful. A reminder of steps 1 to 3, the pledge of responsibility and serenity prayer! And still feeling happy in the moment of now...

Step six and step seven, at sixes and sevens with life... There is always a balance in life where I need a little bit of step six personality traits to keep me on my mettle and step seven personality traits which give me reasonable hope today. I can experience some amount of fear, putting on a brave face and ego and at the same time a dollop of courage, faith and confidence which keeps me happy and motivated and mostly content for a day...

Step 6. ""Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character""
At this point, it would be a good idea to look again at our sharing in step five, where we define character and list a number of our defects. Completing step 5, we have compiled a list of the character defects. Step six is concerned with our spiritual willingness to have these defects of character removed, contingent on each day we meditate and pray in good conscience, and or to God as we understand for ourselves. Seven billion humans, seven billion outlooks and defintions about God every day... yours is as good as it gets today...

I do not speak for Alcoholics Anonymous I speak for myself. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of unique and authentic people who speak for themselves where they will to share experience, strength and hope about recovery on a daily basis. Anonymity affords sanctuary to find how to live sober and be open, honest and willing to learn life day by day. For me ""truth,"" ""love"" and ""wisdom"" offer the best spiritual experience by living reality today. Into the fabric of recovery from alcoholism are woven the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions, steps to be open, honest and willing to learn, traditions to live unity, service and recovery.

To become a Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (MRCPsych), doctors must pass a series of written and clinical examinations. The MRCPsych Examinations consist of three written papers and a practical assessment known as the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) examination.

This is the third in a series of videos released by the College to help increase awareness about the CASC examination, and to help candidates prepare better for the clinical assessment. The videos will be useful not only to trainees and other CASC candidates, but also to their trainers as a basis for discussion.

In this video, a trainee psychiatrist is tasked with taking a history from a patient with alcohol dependency. Detailed information about the task is available at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/CASC%20case%20no%2071030.pdf

Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker in Memphis 1998","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.

Deeply entrenched social stigma have kept recovery voices silent and faces hidden for decades. The vacuum has been filled with sensational mass media depictions of people with addiction that perpetuate a lurid fascination with the dysfunctional side of what is a preventable and treatable health condition. Just like women with breast cancer, or people with HIV/AIDS, a grass roots social justice movement is emerging. Courageous addiction recovery advocates have come out of the shadows and are organizing to end discrimination and move toward recovery-based solutions.

The moving story of The Anonymous People is told through the faces and voices of citizens, leaders, volunteers, corporate executives, public figures, and celebrities who are laying it all on the line to save the lives of others just like them. This passionate new public recovery movement aims to transform public opinion, engage communities and elected officials, and finally shift problematic policy toward lasting solutions.","UCxKozWwkY9PUDVFvkRfKo4Q","2013-12-10T18:43:45.000Z","","67","67510","0","14","515"

"yAXsCn1lmnY","Sister Ignatia Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","Recorded in 1947, Sister Ignatia talks about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

"yAXsCn1lmnY","Sister Ignatia Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","Recorded in 1947, Sister Ignatia talks about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

"yAXsCn1lmnY","Sister Ignatia Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","Recorded in 1947, Sister Ignatia talks about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.
