""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of AA: ""Most of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. We have it with us right here and now. Each day my friend's simple talk in our kitchen multiplies itself in a widening circle of peace on earth and good will to men.""

From Wikipedia: James Patrick Kinnon (5 April 1911 - 9 July 1985), commonly known as Jimmy Kinnon or ""Jimmy K."", was the primary founder of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering addicts. During his lifetime, he was usually referred to as ""Jimmy K."" due to NA's principle of personal anonymity on the public level. He never referred to himself as the founder of NA, although the record clearly shows that he played a founding role.
When Kinnon was seven years old he befriended a local alcoholic who he referred to as Mr. Crookshank. He would often find him drunk and beaten. One day Kinnon found him badly beaten up and unresponsive. Kinnon ran for help. Over the following weeks Kinnon did not see Crookshank and after numerous inquiries his mother took him to see his friend. They went to an institution that Crookshank was now a resident of. He was wheelchair-bound and incoherent. Upon leaving the facility Kinnon told his mother that when he grew up he was going to help people like Mr. Crookshank.
Kinnon was born in Paisley, Scotland on April 5, 1911. He and his parents moved to the United States in the 1920s. For medical reasons he was separated from his parents on Ellis Island for three and a half days. He befriended a Russian family while he was waiting for his sister to be cleared of a medical issue. When the family was reunited they moved to Philadelphia. He never saw the Russian family again. While in Philadelphia Kinnon went to private school and had plans of entering the priesthood. He began using alcohol and drugs which started getting him in trouble. He never followed through with his goal of becoming a priest.
Kinnon stopped using drugs and alcohol on February 2, 1950. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous, a twelve-step program. While in Alcoholics Anonymous he met other members who had struggled with addiction to substances other than alcohol. Alcoholics Anonymous often discouraged members from talking about addictions other than alcohol. Kinnon attended meetings of another group called Habit-forming Drugs but was disappointed with them.
In the summer of 1953 Jimmy Kinnon and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous began holding their own separate meetings, which they called Narcotics Anonymous. Mr. Kinnon and several others were given permission from Alcoholics Anonymous to adapt the AA Twelve Steps, but Jimmy changed the Step 1 from ""Powerless over Alcohol"" to ""Powerless over Addiction."" This a significant change of focus from the AA program because NA is focused on the recovery from the disease of addiction rather than any particular substance that was used. Mr. Kinnon saw that the substance being a symptom of a deeper core issue, (i.e. the thinking, obsession and compulsions) which the substance is used to gain a temporary relief from. Narcotics Anonymous was officially founded in July 1953 in Sun Valley, California. There was a different organization also called Narcotics Anonymous that was previously founded by a recovering addict named Mr. Danny Carlsen in New York City, but it did not follow the 12 Traditions and was more of a social-services organization rather than a Fellowship. It died out in the mid-1960s and was never connected to the NA Mr. Kinnon started in Sun Valley that remains and flourishes all over the world today.
Most of Narcotics Anonymous early literature was written by James Kinnon and is still used worldwide today in over 62,800 NA meetings. He was the main contributor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White booklet that were used throughout the 1960s and 1970s. From 1953 to 1977 Narcotics Anonymous was a safe haven for addicts to meet in their NA meetings, to help each other get and stay clean from all substances, including alcohol, which in truth is a drug. From 1979-1982 hundreds of Narcotics Anonymous members expanded on this literature and created the Basic Text. Mr. Kinnon also designed the NA logo, The Group Logo, The Service Symbol and wrote the Gratitude Prayer and ""Fruit of the Harvest"" statement found in the beginning of the NA book ""The Basic Text"". This book was the first ever known that was written by recovering addicts for recovering addicts. It was first published in 1982.
James Kinnon died of lung cancer on July 9, 1985 in California. Prior to his death he said, if he ever had a headstone it would read, ""All we did was sow some seeds and work and wrought to make this work, so that we and others could live. In Peace, in Freedom and in Love. He was clean for thirty five years at the time of his death.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-07-07T02:28:40.000Z","[u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Narcotics Anonymous Founder', u'Jimmy Kinnon', u'Jimmy K', u'Who started Narcotics Anonymous', u'NA', u'NA Basic Text', u'Addiction Treatment', u'12 step program', u'History of NA', u'History of Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Big Book of AA', u'Who founded narcotics anonymous', u'who founded NA', u'Wedorecover12', u'we do recover', u'addiction', u'recovery', u'xa', u'xa speaker', u'Narcotics anonymous speaker', u'NA Speaker', u'NA Founder', u'Drug', u'Addict', u'Jimmy', u'Kinnon', u'Narcotics', u'Anonymous']","28","44403","0","17","400"

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there! 

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

A special thanks to Joy M. and Matt H. for introducing me to this awesome share. I love hearing such clarity and impassioned sharing about someone's experience. 

Matt has a great speaking style, he has a great sense of timing and wit. Also the way he articulates alcoholism and recovery is very powerful and engaging. The first time I listened to the tape, I put it on, and the hour and a half flew by, I was glued to my headphones. If you are looking for some awesome experience, strength, and hope that is sure to inspire and entertain you, this is the speaker for you! 

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.

In this tape, his razor sharp and quick wit are on display, as well as his stories filled with hilarious antics.  This tape is VERY entertaining.  Also, he articulates the message of recovery in a simple, yet profound way.  Thank you so much for what you do Clancy! Enjoy the tape everyone! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of AA: ""Most of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. We have it with us right here and now. Each day my friend's simple talk in our kitchen multiplies itself in a widening circle of peace on earth and good will to men.""

"lZc9malW7TI","How Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Helps People, Literally.","Alcoholics anonymous does have some great things about it. visit here to discover more: http://truthofaddiction.com/special/ Basically, one thing benefit is that it is used in addiction recovery programs and drug and alcohol treatment centers as a way to help others quit. Some recovery treatment centers do not use sufficient evidence-backed methods, while some use many and holistic approaches to treatment. You can learn more about this on the website. 



According to researchers from Case Western Reserve University, helping the community in various service opportunities has shown to increase sobriety of addicts.

“The research indicates that getting active in service helps alcoholics and other addicts become sober and stay sober, and suggests this approach is applicable to all treatment-seeking individuals with a desire to not drink or use drugs.” (Maria E. Pagano PhD. / School of Medicine).

Researchers have called this the “helping therapy principle” (HTP) and has been in practice at AA to diminish egocentrism. These findings suggest that when an addict finds opportunities to help someone, they actually help themselves.

According to this study, 40 percent of alcoholics who helped other alcoholics were able to avoid drinking during recovery, whereas only 22 percent of those that did not help others, were able to stay sober.

This goes beyond addiction. Individuals with mental and physical health conditions such as body dysmorphic disorder, AIDS or chronic pain also show an improvement from serving others.

Addicts in recovery often find long-term success in “quitting” when they seek something else, something beyond themselves. Addicts may initially just want to become “sober,” but eventually find merit in living an honest life. Addicts are often lying and hiding their behavior from those they love and have a great deal of paranoia and stigma. Living an honest life is usually very attractive to an addict.

Alcoholics anonymous and addiction recovery programs often help one to engage in service which takes the mind off of oneself. Drug and alcohol treatment centers and recovery treatment centers are beneficial when they use these and other techniques.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

The Collected Ernie Kurtz  - http://hindsfoot.org/ktcek1.html




Ernest Kurtz has been the outstanding thinker of the A.A. tradition's second generation, the one who played a constant leadership role in pushing the movement towards the highest professional standards of history writing and supplied some of its most influential interpretive concepts. 

His ideas are vitally important for anyone who wishes to understand A.A. history during the period following Bill Wilson's death in 1971.

As a Ph.D. student at Harvard University in the 1970's, he was the first researcher to be granted full access to the archives of Alcoholics Anonymous. The book that resulted, 

Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous (1979), is still the classic work on early A.A. history. 

His book on the spiritual life -- Ernest Kurtz and Katherine Ketcham, The Spirituality of Imperfection: Modern Wisdom from Classic Stories (1992) 

-- is equally well known, and has also been an enduring best seller through the years since it appeared. His work on Shame & Guilt (orig. pub. 1981, rev. ed. 2007) has given a whole new depth to the discussion of those two vital recovery issues.

"XdCkgJuAgdc","Myers R. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

"3DPJ0-X2XHE","Shawn H. Cocaine Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-02-07T23:47:18.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","9","7823","0","4","130"

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

The references in The Big Book, The 12x12 and AA Comes of Age were likely made in loose regard to the 1913 autobiographical novel by the extremely popular American author Jack London that chronicled his struggles with alcoholism. The novel's title ""John Barleycorn"" was taken from the British folksong of the same name. In the song John Barleycorn represents the vital barley grain crop and the beer and/or whiskey made from it. In the song, John Barleycorn suffers pain, humiliation and death, in ways which are said to represent the growth, cutting and distilling of barley. Around the time of the writing of much of A.A.'s literature ""John Barleycorn"" had come to be used as a euphemism for alcoholism or alcohol. There are many different versions of the song and the content can vary considerably but generally have to do with themes of growth, suffering, death, alcohol, revenge... and barley.

Given the choice, would you play Russian roulette? With a clear head and a focus on reality, would you pick up a gun, with one bullet in one chamber and five empty and spin the chamber, point the gun at your head and fire? The odds favour the stupid and insane. And yet life is about risk, life is about courage, and life is about bravery. And life is about having fun. In our right mind. We wouldn't even consider Russian roulette. And yet everyone doubts the dangers apply to them when it comes to alcohol. The consequences of being out of control impact emotionally and physically. I worked hard and played hard over thirty-five years, alcohol a constant companion. And they say, whoever they are, and I've yet to meet them, ""nothing is wasted in God's economy."" Actually, I'm happy to say that nothing is wasted in God's economy, and I do not want to put the clock back, alcohol served its purpose in my life, at the same time, many people are not alive to tell the tale and only serve as dead examples of the consequences with alcohol...

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there! :)

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

"N2QdhyM4J4c","Alcoholics Anonymous | November 13 | DonInLondon | Step 11 ""Truth Love Wisdom""","2014 Full Daily Blog Link: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/alcoholics-anonymous-blog-november-13.html November 13 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 11 Daily Meditation Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog: http://oddbook.co ] Today's Daily Reflections: ""self aware, prayer and meditation: looking outwards..."" Yes, self-aware, and at the same time prayer, meditation is about unity, service and recovery. Looking outwards rather than being self-absorbed or selfish. Looking at the big picture, how we fit into the big picture, not running the whole show, simply being part of something, with and around people, places and things...

In those darkest days, when the old behaviour and addictive ways were out of control, I could not see the impact I had myself or other people. There was consternation and fear inside me and those who kept on trying to help became fearful that I could not help myself and they could not save me from myself: that is the nature of addiction and no way out. My experience is joining the fellowship made it possible to learn and be supported every single day by a large number of people who were all in recovery, from a few hours to a great number of years. Some say it takes a village to raise a child... And for me to get into recovery and stay in recovery it has taken a fellowship. I have gratitude for everyone who made this possible one day at a time...

Being self-aware and able to pray and meditate, whether we believe in God or not, improves our outlook on a daily basis. With practice, being self-aware, praying and meditating is not a lengthy process. Most often comes down to this for me: ""how am I feeling?"" And, ""why?"" And then, ""what can I do?"" Three simple questions. And it only takes moments to find balance, knowing my mood, how it is impacting on my thinking and the actions which may follow. And if I don't know what to do, I can ask for help rather than try to tough it out and pretend to be okay when I'm not...

Every day I am challenged by my old ways and the darker side, where fear, putting on a brave face and ego will keep me selfish in my outlook. And equally challenged to live to a new set of principles which offer: faith in the next right thing, courage to change and confidence which grows with the experience. Step six the old ways and being stuck in a defensive attitude, or step seven: working on my shortcomings to be open, honest and willing to change. Sometimes one step back, and then two steps forward, or any combination. Life experience offers the challenge, the principles of the twelve steps and twelve traditions, enabling everyone to have more personal choices and personal freedom one day at a time...

How am I feeling today? The answer is simple, right now, somewhat vague and listening to the thrum of London waking up. It's going to be rush hour for millions, trying to cram in as much as they can all day long. Walking to bus stops, walking to trains and tubes and so many gazing into their mobile phones... I wonder how well each person can look out. Looking outward, self-aware and weighing up what is going on, included in a world which suits them or suits no one... In balance? Or driven out of balance? And my plan in all this: to be open, honest and willing. To help and support, to cherish people, and befriend anyone caught in difficulty if and when the time is appropriate today...

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.

"OsEA5Duu18g","Rick W. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more...""

This talk deals with the all-important aspect of alcoholism and addiction being a family disease.  It deals with how we relate to our families and how they relate to us.  GREAT tape with LOTS of useful tools and insights! 

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.

He has an entertaining and engaging style and he is really hilarious as he details his adventures in his addiction and recovery!  This is a MUST LISTEN for anyone who is clean in a program or who wants to get clean but does not know how.  Thank you so much for a wonderful share Alan! 

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.

Some funny stories, powerful instances of healing, and rock-solid recovery in this tape! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.

Beyond Addiction (the book) - the website is coming soon.  Until then, use: http://the20minuteguide.com/cmc/beyond-addiction/

Josh King, Psy.D. from the Center for Motivation and Change based in NY will talk about evidence-based treatment, what we can do to be more informed in our choices and about CRAFT for families that are suffering from addiction. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT)
Using the core strategies in CRA (Community Reinforcement Approach) Drs. Robert J. Meyers and Jane Ellen Smith of the University of New Mexico developed a program that teaches families how to positively impact a loved one who is struggling with a substance use problem. The CRAFT program avoids both detachment and confrontation, the respective strategies of Al-Anon ( a Twelve Step-based self-help approach), and traditional (Johnson Institute-style) interventions. While all three approaches have been found to improve family members' functioning and relationship satisfaction, CRAFT has proven to be significantly more effective in engaging loved ones in comparison to the Johnson Institute Intervention or Al-Anon/Nar-Anon facilitation therapy.

Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) teaches family and friends effective strategies for helping their loved one to change and for feeling better themselves. CRAFT works to affect the loved one's behavior by changing the way the family interacts with him or her. It is designed to accomplish three goals:

1. When a loved one is abusing substances and refusing to get help, CRAFT helps families move their loved one toward treatment.

2. On its own, CRAFT helps reduce the loved one's alcohol and drug use, whether or not the loved one has engaged in treatment yet.

3. CRAFT improves the lives of the concerned family and friends.

CRAFT is a skills-based program that impacts families in multiple areas of their lives, including self-care, pleasurable activities, problem solving, and goal setting. At the same time, CRAFT addresses their loved one's resistance to change. CRAFT teaches families behavioral and motivational strategies for interacting with their loved one. Participants learn, for example, the power of positive reinforcement for positive behavior (and of withdrawing it for unwanted behavior), and how to use positive communication skills to improve interactions and maximize their influence.

Specifically, CRAFT teaches several skills, including:
Understanding a loved one's triggers to use substances
Positive communication strategies
Positive reinforcement strategies -- rewarding non-using behavior
Problem-solving
Self-care
Domestic violence precautions
Getting a loved one to accept help

In multiple studies, across a range of substances and settings, CRAFT engaged on average 7 out of 10 reluctant loved ones into treatment.","UCwe4REium_jPz26MyKicXJQ","2013-12-30T19:13:32.000Z","[u'#hangoutsonair', u'Hangouts On Air', u'#hoa', u'Center for Motivation and Change', u'motivationandchange.com', u'theaddictionshow.com', u'Community Reinforcement and Family Training', u'Josh King Psy.D.', u'Addiction', u'Addiction Alternatives', u'Recovery Alternatives', u'Positive Reinforcement', u'Beyond Addiction', u'evidence based treatments', u'addiction treatment', u'non 12 step', u'Robert J.

"aZnSykr7TgA","Psychotherapy's role in mutual aid based recovery from addiction and alcoholism -- Noel Mcd","In the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous, the most well known of the mutual aid programs for addiction recovery, the views of Dr Freud and CG Jung were sought on the predicament of the alcoholic and the prognosis if utilising psychoanalytic or analytic psychology approaches.

Dr Freud apparently told the founders of AA that his method could not help the chronic alcoholic. Mr Jung in letters to one of the founders Bill W, suggested the alcoholic needed the help of a 'wall of humanity' to sustain abstinence from alcoholic dependence and thereby death or incurable brain disease.

Hence was born the notion of 'fellowship' or as we call it professionally, mutual aid. Inside the wall of humanity the recovering alcoholic-addict rebuilds their sense of self to engage with the world again.

How can we as psychotherapists engage with this process? This was the substance of the conversation with Noel McDermott. A psychotherapist who specialises in facilitating addicts into mutual aid programs.

Noel explored some of the evidence base for mutual aid, present his work in the main form of mutual aid '12 Step' (AA. NA. CoDA. Al-Anon. Al-Ateen. SLAA. OA. GA. UA etc). Looking at the dynamics of the steps, how they interface into psychotherapeutic practice.

Noel McDermott

Noel has worked in health, child and social care since the mid 1980's. Initially as a community worker in Birmingham's area of Handsworth, developing a deep attachment to diversity that is characteristic of his approach to life.

After University as an undergraduate he pursued a love of theatre and the arts. Working as a community arts worker. Noel took his arts background into his training as a specialist psychotherapist (dramatherapy) qualifying as a post-graduate in 1996. Post qualification he achieved and maintained statutory registration and currently is licensed to practice with the Health and Care Professions Council. He moved to Scotland working in adult community mental health, psychiatric in-patient, forensic and social services settings.

On return to London he worked in social services settings; managing services to refugees, children, families and adults across all service areas. Then he moved into the third sector working with trauma, children and their families, adult mental health, addictions.

Over time he has integrated CBT, solution focused and brief approaches, family work and recovery based practices to his original psychodynamic training. He is a pragmatist. He is currently interested in ongoing research from neurosciences as well as uses of Web 2.0 and online spaces.

Self-centeredness was my problem. All my life people had been doing things for me and I not only expected it, but I was ungrateful and resentful they didn't do more. Why should I help others, when they were supposed to help me? If others had troubles, didn't they deserve them? I was filled with self-pity, anger and resentment. Then I learned that by helping others, with no thought of return, I could overcome this obsession with selfishness, and if I understood humility, I would know peace and serenity.

Courageous addiction recovery advocates have come out of the shadows and are organizing to end discrimination and move toward recovery-based solutions.

"N0VBirutgZE","Max G. Cocaine Anonymous Speaker","From Wikipedia: Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. CA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, identifying specifically as a cocaine addict is not required.
CA uses the book Alcoholics Anonymous as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous, and the AA book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.
CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by a long-standing AA member. He worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. Recognizing that there was a need for support of family and friends of drug addicts, the group Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) was formed. Co-Anon is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-02-14T04:01:42.000Z","[u'Cocaine Anonymous (Organization)', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'CA', u'Hope faith and courage', u'Hope', u'faith', u'courage', u'Cocaine anonymous world service', u'CA world service', u'Cocaine anonymous world convention', u'CA world convention', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'odontology', u'xa', u'ca.org', u'we do recover', u'wedorecover12', u'carry the message']","0","1486","0","0","7"

"8SRhNHT7jrg","Alcoholics Anonymous, San Pedro, Belize.mp4","This past Sunday, Alcoholic Anonymous branches from around the country and Mexico met at the San Pablo Church where many decisions were made. These decisions have spiralled a re-energized feeling and now, members are happy to work towards joining the international Alcoholics Anonymous organization. It sure is a big feat and one that they have certainly tried before. This time, they are hopeful that the members are ready to step it up a notch.
______________________________________________________________________

Kainie Manuel reporting: Alcoholics Anonymous has been working in Belize for the past 20 years and although many times they have worked to form part of the International Organization, their efforts have always fallen short. This past Sunday, however, a re-energized group met at the San Pablo church, where among other things discussed, a new push for international recognition has now been set into motion.

First item on the agenda was a discussion and presentation on the actual structure utilized by Alcoholics Anonymous. Starting with a proper organization structure where a home base is located. With branches in San Pedro, Belize, Orange Walk, Corozal, and recently formed Caye Caulker, it was decided that an official Alcoholics Anonymous office will be secured in Belize City. Belize City is the central point, where all branches can get together, rather than traveling district to district every month for meetings. These meetings will be attended by the coordinator, secretary and or treasurer of each branch. 

A new board was installed and all members left feeling re-energized and motivated for a new way forward for Alcoholics Anonymous. 

Another item of the agenda was discussing membership. It was stated that in the country of Belize there are 50 members of Alcoholics Anonymous, looking to make a change from their addiction into a better life. In San Pedro alone, there are between 25-30 members, but the coordinator believes that there are many more people on the island that need help. ""That is what we want everyone to know, we are here to be your support and strength. We are here to help individuals, families and our society."" Was the final quote delivered during the meeting.

"bXM5YpR0Gf4","Marijuana Maintenance: Cannabis for Alcohol Dependence","You might be saying to yourself, why do we need to use medical marijuana for alcohol dependence--can't we just send everybody to a 12 step program and make them quit completely? The answer to this is a simple no. Although 12 step programs are great for the people that they work for, the simple fact is that 12 step programs fail to help the majority of people with alcohol problems. According to the National Institute On Alcohol Abuse And Alcoholism, only one out of every fourteen people with an Alcohol Use Disorder will ever seek treatment for it. And according to Doctor Jeffrey Brandsma and others who have researched the effectiveness of treatment programs, over two thirds of people who enroll in 12 step treatment programs will drop out without finishing them. Twelve step programs are great for the people that they work for, but something else is needed for the majority of problem drinkers who are failed by them. Fortunately, medical marijuana can fill that need for many people suffering from alcohol use disorders.

Some people might view the use of medical marijuana to treat alcohol dependence as simply substituting one addiction for another. However, when we view things from a public health perspective, we find that there is a tremendous difference in the impact of alcohol dependence when compared to marijuana use. Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome is accompanied by seizures, hallucinations, tremors, irregular heartbeat, and spikes in blood pressure. Untreated severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome leads to death in one out of every three cases.

By way of contrast there is NO physical withdrawal from cannabis. People who are subject to alcohol withdrawal syndrome can benefit greatly by substituting medical marijuana for alcohol. The same is true for people who become violent or otherwise lose control of their behavior when drinking--pot might make you mellow but it won't make you violent. People who have suffered liver damage from alcohol abuse can also benefit from medical marijuana because cannabis is not toxic to the liver.

Some people might think that if you give medical marijuana to alcoholics they will both drink and smoke pot and have a double addiction. However, ALL of the research contradicts this assumption. In every single case where medical marijuana has been used as a treatment for alcoholism patients have reported either major reduction in alcohol consumption or complete abstinence from alcohol.

Doctor Tod Mikuriya has been prescribing medical marijuana for a number of conditions including alcoholism for many years. In 2004 he published his research on the use of medical marijuana to treat alcohol dependence. Doctor Mikuriya prescribed cannabis to 92 patients suffering from Alcohol Use Disorders. Every single one of these 92 patients reported a major reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems. Nine patients reported that they managed to abstain from alcohol completely for a year or longer. All attributed this to the effects of medical marijuana.

Research on Medical Marijuana published in 2009 by Amanda Reiman of the School of Social Welfare of the University of California, Berkeley gave similar results. Patients who were prescribed medical marijuana showed great reductions in their consumption of alcohol or other drugs as well as great reductions in drug or alcohol related harms

It all goes to show that the substitution of cannabis for alcohol or other drugs is one of the most successful harm reduction strategies ever invented.

Medical marijuana is now legal in 14 states. If nothing else works for your alcohol problem, then give medical cannabis a shot. The life you save may be your own.

Thank you.

As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking.""

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
Voluntary fellowship of people suffering from alcoholism who seek to become and stay sober through mutual self-help by meeting in local, independent groups to share their common experience. Anonymity, confidentiality, and understanding of alcoholism as a disease free members to speak frankly. Many consider AA to be the most successful method of coping with alcoholism; participation raises the chances of success of other treatments. Its 12 steps to recovery include acknowledgment of the problem, faith in a ""higher power"" as understood by each individual, self-examination, and a desire to change for the better and to help others recover. Begun in 1935 by two alcoholics, AA has grown to some 2 million members worldwide. Similar organizations for abusers of other substances and for habitual gamblers and debtors are based on its principles.

addiction  [uh-dik-shuhn] Show IPA
addiction:  see drug addiction and drug abuse.
The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia Copyright © 2004.

drug addiction
or chemical dependency
Physical and/or psychological dependency on a psychoactive (mind-altering) substance (e.g., alcohol, narcotics, nicotine), defined as continued use despite knowing that the substance causes harm. Physical dependency results when the body builds up a tolerance to a drug, needing increasing doses to achieve the desired effects and to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Psychological dependency may have more to do with one's psychological makeup; some people may have a genetic tendency to addiction. The most common addictions are to alcohol ( see alcoholism), barbiturates, tranquilizers, and amphetamines, as well as to the stimulants nicotine and caffeine. Initial treatment (detoxification) should be conducted with medical supervision. Individual and group psychotherapy are critical elements. Alcoholics Anonymous and similar support groups can increase the success rate of other efforts. The ability to admit addiction and the will to change are necessary first steps.

Addiction
The term "" addiction "" is used in many contexts to describe an obsession, compulsion, or excessive physical dependence or psychological dependence, such as: drug addiction, alcoholism, compulsive overeating, problem gambling, computer addiction, etc.

In medical terminology, addiction  is a state in which the body relies on a substance for normal functioning and develops physical dependence, as in drug addiction. When the drug or substance on which someone is dependent is suddenly removed, it will cause withdrawal, a characteristic set of signs and symptoms. Addiction is generally associated with increased drug tolerance. In physiological terms, addiction is not necessarily associated with substance abuse since this form of addiction can result from using medication as prescribed by a doctor.

However, common usage of the term addiction  has spread to include psychological dependence. In this context, the term is used in drug addiction and substance abuse problems, but also refers to behaviours that are not generally recognised by the medical community as problems of addiction, such as compulsive overeating.

The term addiction  is also sometimes applied to compulsions that are not substance-related, such as problem gambling and computer addiction. In these kinds of common usages, the term addiction  is used to describe a recurring compulsion by an individual to engage in some specific activity, despite harmful consequences to the individual's health, mental state or social life.

physics  [fiz-iks]  Show IPA
physics,  branch of science traditionally defined as the study of matter, energy, and the relation between them; it was called natural philosophy until the late 19th cent. and is still known by this name at a few universities. Physics is in some senses the oldest and most basic pure science; its discoveries find applications throughout the natural sciences, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics.","UCR5DtVTBy11-R-dBgW4izig","2012-08-12T01:19:31.000Z","[u'AA', u'Httpswwwfacebookcompages']","3","289","0"

"fu3JrlNTnDc","Polly P. - AA Speaker - ""Inner Healing and Inner Peace""","One of the best AA speakers, Polly P., shares a wonderful mini-workshop on inner healing, and how recovery is truly an inside out process.  Trying to fix external things and circumstances never really does anything but delay the inevitable.  

The life-changing process of the Twelve Steps of AA can bring about a powerful and transformational healing experience.  Steps 4 and 5 are extremely helpful in this process and a critical point in the recovery process.  Polly absolutely nails it with this AWESOME share! Thank you so much Polly, you are such an inspiration! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

"8LV1Fm0hppY","AA Is a DEATH SENTENCE","As long as we continue under the current ""addiction treatment"" modality we will continue to convince people they are powerless. And as long as they believe this they will not see the other options available to them. We are basically giving people two choices right now. A choice between their substance and an outdated, ineffective, even harmful and dangerous ""program"" of ""recovery"" that involves going cold turkey to achieve complete abstinence for life. And if they don't want that they are offered 'tough love' and a kick to the curb, sometimes for so little as a slip, until they are 'beat up enough to be willing.' That is the prevalent attitude of many people, an attitude accepted, and promoted in large part by today's multibillion dollar treatment industry. This is killing people dead. -Jason Bartley

People die every day because AA FAILS 97% of the people who go there.  Their favorite rebuttal to this fact is to say, ""It works if you work it,"" implying that if AA doesn't work for you it is because you couldn’t be honest and willing or refused to accept a Higher Power. Therefore you failed at AA, when in fact it was AA that failed you. They make it a habit to tell people who are suffering from a mental illness not to take their medication(s).  How can any morally sound mental health worker endorse finding ""recovery"" and ""god"" in such a horrible place?  Why not just tell someone what religion they should be?  Because that is exactly what AA is, a dangerous religious organization!  So why is AA held in such high regard in the US?

Meeting makers make it!  When I first started to attend meetings I would be the one sat in the back ready to leave as soon as the hour was up.  I did not speak and share anything.  I just sat.  The things was I the more I listened the more I could hear my story from the mouths of others.  It did not matter if they were young or old, black or white, male or female.   Every story had things I could relate too.
I realized this was a safe place where together we could all share a bit of us to help each other.  There was no judgement just understanding.

"Y_idxNMuCq8","Examining Spiritual Addiction: the ego's craving, avoidance, denial behaviors (1 of 7)","Addiction, desires, cravings, avoidance, denial, repression -- these are all behaviors of the ego.  The ego has within it strong behaviors that create inner suffering.  Learn how to uncover and remove these dysfunctional parts of yourself in this higher consciousness teaching.

This is a 1.5 hour conversation between Lincoln, the channel for Higher Self, and a student of the Higher Self teachings.  You will learn about Lincoln's own experience with the personal ego and how he understands many of the core behaviors of the ego function operating with us.  

Many of the ego's behaviors are the same as the substance addicted person - intense cravings, avoidance of the present moment, denial and repression of unhappy memories, etc.  By understanding the structure of the ego, we are most effectively able to eliminate any personal problems, whether they are manifesting as strongly as a person struggling with alcoholism or substance abuse, or as mildly a person with a healthy ego structure or even a spiritual student.   As long as the ego exists, some of these core patterns will be controlling our conscious behavior and limiting our experience of inner peace and Divine Love.

In this teaching you will learn new ways to uncover the layers of the personal ego, including how to eliminate the denial mechanism that keeps deeply held beliefs and memories locked in our subconscious mind.  As long as any deep karma is within our subconscious mind it is affecting our conscious reality.  So a safe, intelligent and Divinely-guided removal of our deepest karmas is essential for our own personal purification and spiritual awakening.   Learn the steps how to perform this self-exploration and inner purification.

This conversation will help you to understand the experience of spiritual awakening and spiritual purification as related to the personal ego and it's functions.  Because many people have expressed the benefits of previous conversations of this nature, this conversation is being shared.  It is the hope of Lincoln and this woman that many people benefit from the clear and direct communication in this video. This conversation has been shared with the full permission of the recipient.  Her privacy is upheld.

Many blessings and much Love!

Center for Healthy Sex presents a lecture by Ethlie Ann Vare: ""Love Addict: Sex, Romance and Fantasy - A Toxic Trio""

""The Sex Experts"" is a monthly webinar series for sex therapists and specialists to present educational and informational material for the general public. 

Webinar Description: 
You might be a love addict if…
* You check his (or her) Facebook page before you check your own.
* You leave a second (or third, or fourth) voice mail message before the first message is returned, just in case (a) he didn't hear it properly; (b) he's shy and needs encouragement: (c) maybe you dialed wrong: (d) maybe you forgot to leave a callback number; (e) maybe he called and you missed it; or....
* You changed your route home to pass your love object's house. Extra points for parking outside the house and waiting.
* You have checked your lover's e-mail, their text messages... or their underwear.
* Your Life List of sex partners is in the three figures. (For rock stars and professional athletes, make that four figures).
* You really believe you can save that [stripper, biker, serial philanderer, suicide survivor, alcoholic] with the depth and the purity of your love.
   Ethlie Ann Vare has a pet name for her lifelong tendency to fall for unavailable men... or dangerous men... or any man in the vicinity. She calls it ""Affection Deficit Disorder,"" a quirk which manifested in, among other things, too much sex with too many men and heartaches by the number. It was only after she worked her way through a few marriages and a nasty cocaine habit that she identified her core problem: sex and love addiction.
   Eventually successful in her own recovery, she decided to help others identify and better understand what is truly a debilitating disease. The result was LOVE ADDICT: SEX, ROMANCE AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS (HCI Books, 2011), a look at the topic from both the personal and the clinical perspectives, told with humor and compassion.
   Love addiction, it turns out, isn't like cocaine addiction at all. It's exactly the same thing.

Award-winning author, journalist, and screenwriter Ethlie Ann Vare has survived four marriages, drug addiction, jail, and network television. The wit behind the hot humor blog Affection Deficit Disorder, Ethlie started out as a rock-n-roll disc jockey, became known as an expert on pop culture and excelled as a syndicated newspaper columnist. Her books range from biographies of superstars (Stevie Nicks, Ozzy Osbourne, Legend: Frank Sinatra and the American Dream) to adventures in distant galaxies (Andromeda: The Broken Places). She is a featured speaker on campuses nationwide on the topic of women who have made history (Mothers of Invention, Patently Female).. Most recently she has been writing for TV shows from the ridiculous (Beastmaster) to the sublime (CSI).

Center for Healthy Sex (CHS) is a community therapy center in Los Angeles that specializes in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, sexual anorexia, porn addiction, sex addiction, and love addiction. Clients participate in the diverse programs, online courses and social services offered at Center for Healthy Sex - ranging from weekly support groups, couples sex therapy, and the 11-day Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) to online classes, free lectures and podcasts. Center for Healthy Sex was co-founded by Alexandra Katehakis, MFT, CST-S, CSAT-S, and Douglas Evans in 2005. Their stated mission is to offer men, women, and couples a safe place to receive professional psychotherapy to resolve shame, guilt, deception, or other barriers to healthy eroticism.

With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2014-03-17T20:34:57.000Z","[u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'AA', u'AA Speaker', u'Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker', u'AA Big Book', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Services', u'aa.org', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Convention', u'Twelve Steps and Twelve traditions', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'xa speakers', u'Bill W', u'Bill Wilson', u'xa', u'wedorecover12', u'we do recover 12', u'carry the message']","0","352","0","1","1"

“A.A. had its beginnings in 1935 at Akron, Ohio, as the outcome of a meeting between Bill W., a New York stockbroker, and Dr. Bob S., an Akron surgeon. Both had been hopeless alcoholics. Prior to that time, Bill and Dr. Bob had each been in contact with the Oxford Group, a mostly nonalcoholic fellowship that emphasized universal spiritual values in daily living.""

AA Without the God:

“It’s a comment I’ve heard often in my years helping those with addictions: “I tried AA, but I just couldn’t get past the God part. The God part, of course, refers to the references to God and spirituality that appear in Alcoholics Anonymous(link is external)literature – the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions in particular – as well as to the more overt signs of religion that can be part of some AA meetings, such as the reciting of the Lord’s Prayer.""

""Alcohol primarily interferes with the ability to form new long–term memories, leaving intact previously established long–term memories and the ability to keep new information active in memory for brief periods. As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking.""

"j_qEglrLReQ","7 things children of alcoholics should know","This is in honor of Children of Alcoholics Week (Feb. 10-16) for everyone affected by alcoholism in their families. I am an advocate for and friend to kids coping with the effects of parental or other loved ones' alcoholism. I'm an active volunteer at children's programs. I'm also the author of a hopeful novel for tweens about parental alcoholism. 

***
I'm 30 years old. On each of these 11,000 or so days I've been alive, I've been negatively affected by alcoholism in my family. These alcoholics caused me a lot of worry, pain and terribly tough times. I am stronger for it but I wish I'd known earlier what I know today.

Here are seven major things you should know:

1. You're so not alone.

One in four American kids lives with at least one parent who's an alcoholic. 

2. You haven't and you can't cause your parents or other people to drink.

Regardless of what an alcoholic may tell you, you can't cause someone to drink or drink more or stop drinking. Alcoholics drink because they're addicted. When they're disappointed in themselves, they blame others for their decisions.

3. You can't cure it. You can't control it. You can't make them stop drinking. 

No matter what I did, they drank.

Not only did I waste my time and stop taking good care of myself, I actually often prevented my alcoholic loved ones from realizing that they needed help.

Finally, as a grownup, I learned that alcoholics only stop drinking if they accept that they're addicted, that they need help and then get it.

4. You have one ultra-critical, top-priority job in the world.

Your responsibility in life is to make sure you're safe, healthy and happy. That's it. If you do not feel safe, you need to ask for help. If you're worried all of the time, you need to ask for help. If you do not feel hopeful about the future, you need to ask for help.

5. Ignore stupid grownups.

Listen to those who tell you're going to make your dreams happen. Your talents and experiences are not by chance. You are here for an important reason. You don't have to go down the path that your family members did -- and despite whatever challenges come along when you're at that fork in the road, you'll pick the different route. You will break the cycle. Amazing YOU! You're going to grow up and have an extraordinary life. Believe it!

6. School yourself.

What my family called ""little drinking problems"" were actually severe cases of alcoholism. I learned that the more addicted a person becomes, the harder it is for the person to stop. Their brains change. They need help. They need counseling and doctors. I learned that this a widespread, global problem and I didn't feel alone anymore.

School yourself about alcoholism: http://www.JodyLamb.com/Resources 

7. Help is there.

Talk to a grownup you trust such as another family member, a teacher or a counselor about what's happening at home.

Alateen meetings - http://www.al-anon.alateen.org

If you do not feel safe, at any time of the day or night, please, please call this number and a counselor will help you: 1-800-422-4453.

***
About my novel Easter Ann Peters' Operation Cool: I hope young people are moved by the characters' determination and hope. For readers with alcoholics in their lives, I hope that they're reminded that they are not alone and that they're inspired by the characters' discovery of the solution to improve their life situations. For readers who do not have alcoholics in their lives, I hope they'll gain a more solid understanding of what alcoholism is, how it affects others and sensitivity to what their classmates, teammates and neighbors may be coping with at home. 

This novel is the first of many for me. I'm currently writing non-fiction for kids about coping when loved ones are addicted to alcohol or other drugs. I intend to find a way to provide these at no cost to kids. My first young adult novel is also in progress. 

Why I'm writing books about this: http://youtu.be/hDK6PGt3Rk4.

"CmD7qFS2Snk","Bill W. History of the Big Book","This co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous recalls his memories of events that happened during the writing of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Thank you for listening, enjoy!

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

"NDBD-D25ItA","The unseen face of meth use","What does a meth user look like? You’re probably not picturing Courtney – and that’s one reason why it’s so important to hear his story.  



In the 1990s and early 2000s, meth became the most widely used illicit drug among urban gay men. ""Early characterizations of the meth problem in the gay community depicted the party boy or the middle-class white man as the prototype of the meth user,"" says Dr. Perry Halkitis, professor of applied psychology, global public health, and medicine at New York University.

Public health campaigns in the early 2000s targeted white gay meth users as a way of combating the AIDS epidemic. This, Halkitis believes, created a stigma among middle- and upper-class white gay men and pushed the drug underground in the gay community. And while Halkitis says meth use is still common among all subsets of the gay population, a recent study of his found meth now disproportionately affects HIV-positive and African-American gay men.

To make this short, filmmaker Spencer Macnaughton spent weeks of chatting online with many men and attending a Crystal Meth Anonymous meeting at New York's LGBT Community Center, where 38 gay male ex-meth users shared their recovery stories.

"WuwOXDWHZ-o","Alcohol Addiction Treatment And Self Help - How to Stop Drinking and Start Recovery","http://www.soberlifeusa.com | 1-855-454-3387

Overcoming an addiction to alcohol can be a long and bumpy road. At times, it may even feel impossible. But it's not. If you're ready to stop drinking and willing to get the support you need, you can recover from alcoholism and alcohol abuse—no matter how bad the addiction or how powerless you feel. You don't have to wait until you hit rock bottom; you can make a change at any time.

Most people with alcohol problems do not decide to make a big change out of the blue or transform their drinking habits overnight. Recovery is usually a more gradual process. In the early stages of change, denial is a huge obstacle. Even after admitting you have a drinking problem, you may make excuses and drag your feet. It's important to acknowledge your ambivalence about stopping drinking. If you're not sure if you're ready to change or you're struggling with the decision, it can help to think about the costs and benefits.

Managing alcohol cravings
When you're struggling with alcohol cravings, try these strategies:
- Talk to someone you trust: your sponsor, a supportive family member or friend, or someone from your faith community. 
- Distract yourself until the urge passes. Go for a walk, listen to music, do some housecleaning, run an errand, or tackle a quick task. 
- Remind yourself of your reasons for not drinking. When you're craving alcohol, there's a tendency to remember the positive effects of drinking and forget the negatives.Remind yourself that drinking won't really make you feel better. 
- Accept the urge and ride it out, instead of trying to fight it. This is known as ""urge surfing."" Think of your craving as an ocean wave that will soon crest, break, and dissipate. When you ride out the craving, without trying to battle, judge, or ignore it, you'll see that it passes more quickly than you'd think. 

Alcohol recovery is a process—one that often involves setbacks. Don't give up if you relapse or slip. A drinking relapse doesn't mean you're a failure or that you'll never be able to reach your goal. Each drinking relapse is an opportunity to learn and recommit to sobriety, so you'll be less likely to relapse in the future.

When you opt for the increased success rates common to some of the top residential recovery centers, you give yourself or your loved one the best chance of achieving and maintaining sobriety. However, you'll still need to consider whether to seek addiction treatment locally or take it out-of-state, putting distance between you and any abuse triggers. If you know someone who has gone through an alcoholic recovery program or has received drug treatment, ask them their opinion on the program they attended! For everyone else, calling a toll-free recovery hotline - whether it's ours or another reputable service's - is an excellent way to start. You can discuss your local drug and alcohol recovery program options and have any questions answered that you might have about substance abuse insurance coverage.

"T_sHfh6yWao","Alcoholics Anonymous | Jan 2 2015 | DonInLondon | Step 1 ""Freedom""","January 2 2014  [ Full daily blog: http://donoddylondon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/alcoholics-anonymous-jan-2-2014.html ]  AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 1 ""Powerless"" | Alcoholics Anonymous The beginning of a new chapter and a new day. January 1, 2013, bright and sunny, and a relief and a wondering what to do next. I need to start at the beginning again. And what better place to start with some basics of what makes life work for me.

The serenity prayer, which can be said to God, or as an exhortation to God, or depending on your faith and beliefs an exhortation to good, simply the good of life: the serenity prayer, ""God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""

Serenity is a state of mind which can be lived. Serenity in the moment of now, even when life is chaotic, even when life is good, bad and ugly. Serenity needs to be in the moment of now, or it is history, and it is something we try and attain in the future. If we don't have serenity now, and live serenity, what is the point?

And January is a very good month to start again with an understanding of the twelve steps and the twelve traditions. I need to read the twelve and twelve, the twelve steps and the twelve traditions of the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. The absolute bedrock of recovery is living the steps and incorporating the philosophy and the practicality they offer anyone anywhere at any time. And this needs to be part of my morning reflections. I share them and have done for quite a while. Today, being the first day of the New Year, I felt the need to let go some of the publishing I have been doing over the last few years. And just put it in one place rather than a scattergun approach, with blogs, here there and everywhere is not necessarily worthwhile. Or is it? Probably the most important thing is there is a message of experience, strength and hope being shared by many people in whatever way they find appropriate. I just want to be one of many who shares, I don't want to be better or worse than anybody else and I felt like I might be overdoing some elements and crowding out the voices of other people. Sometimes I feel that way. Meetings, I put my hand up to speak, automatically because that is what I feel I need do. And then I shut up, not sure what to do. And these uncertainties are really important, it is part of life, not to know the answers and ask for help.

January 1, 2013, an evening meeting, at one of the venues I like to call a spiritual hut. It is actually a hut and old scouting hut. It now serves many purposes as part of a great big church organisation here in my local community. During the day, it serves as a nursery and in the evenings and weekends can be used for many reasons, providing you pay for it. Anyway, last night as it is now January 2, it was busy, messy, unruly, and full of promise. Many newcomers, many people from other meetings and abroad from Europe from far flung places like the Americas... A real mix of real alcoholics getting to grips with reality, or not getting to grips with anything!

The impact on me? I love hurly-burly, I love talking to new people as the meeting numbers grow and we meet people we know and people we don't know. The queue for the teas and coffee, seems to take a lifetime and is eating at the time before the meeting. I chat to a friend, find a seat and sit down before the seat is lost to someone else. Standing room only on New Year's Day... continues...

"px7CGCZ1daU","Chris R. and Myers R. - AA Speakers - ""Our Common Solution""","Chris and Myers are on fire again with this AWESOME tape on the tremendous fact that we have a common solution to our common problem (alcoholism).  In their clear-cut and entertaining approach to the Big Book, they share their experience with the ""common solution"" of the 12 Step Program of Recovery! Love it! 

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

http://wedontneedgod.wordpress.com/

It is ironic to me that in seeking to recover from absolute, life wrecking addiction many counselors, specifically Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, would advocate another kind of dependence. Their 12 steps advise that believing that you have no power over your own life and that only a mystical god can heal you is the proper road to recovery. What they fail to realize, apart from the fact that there is no such thing as god, is that it is that kind of dependence which is soul-sucking. To offer the abdication of ones mind and judgment as a remedy for the abdication of ones mind and judgment, stating that a different master is what is necessary ignores a crucial element of human nature. Independence is a requirement of human life. It is the fire in a persons soul. It is what enables them to drive themselves toward goals of their choosing. It also means that a person is responsible for the choices they make and the goals they set, and that the rewards or punishments from those actions are theirs alone to receive. By accepting the standard of dependence and irresponsibility, the counselors set the stage for psychological frustration, specifically a lack of self-worth that comes from knowing that life is worth living and that you are capable of living it.

Addiction to drugs and alcohol is a symptom of a minds attempt to escape, not from reality, but from itself. It is a manifestation of frustration, of the wordless struggle, implicitly stating this is how the world is, yet it cannot be. Faith, the belief in something contrary to the facts or evidence, is the main perpetrator of such cognitive dissonance.

In the realm of ideas, everything counts. One cannot simply say If believing in god makes him happy, why not? This precisely is why. This one false idea breeds ignorance and destruction into every mind that accepts it, and corrupts even the noblest of processes.

For true addiction recovery and prevention, we dont need god. We need a a moral philosophy that teaches responsibility and independence, which we wont find in any religion.

"fmeh-JLAFlg","Examining Spiritual Addiction: the ego's craving, avoidance, denial behaviors (5 of 7)","Addiction, desires, cravings, avoidance, denial, repression -- these are all behaviors of the ego.  The ego has within it strong behaviors that create inner suffering.  Learn how to uncover and remove these dysfunctional parts of yourself in this higher consciousness teaching.

This is a 1.5 hour conversation between Lincoln, the channel for Higher Self, and a student of the Higher Self teachings.  You will learn about Lincoln's own experience with the personal ego and how he understands many of the core behaviors of the ego function operating with us.  

Many of the ego's behaviors are the same as the substance addicted person - intense cravings, avoidance of the present moment, denial and repression of unhappy memories, etc.  By understanding the structure of the ego, we are most effectively able to eliminate any personal problems, whether they are manifesting as strongly as a person struggling with alcoholism or substance abuse, or as mildly a person with a healthy ego structure or even a spiritual student.   As long as the ego exists, some of these core patterns will be controlling our conscious behavior and limiting our experience of inner peace and Divine Love.

In this teaching you will learn new ways to uncover the layers of the personal ego, including how to eliminate the denial mechanism that keeps deeply held beliefs and memories locked in our subconscious mind.  As long as any deep karma is within our subconscious mind it is affecting our conscious reality.  So a safe, intelligent and Divinely-guided removal of our deepest karmas is essential for our own personal purification and spiritual awakening.   Learn the steps how to perform this self-exploration and inner purification.

This conversation will help you to understand the experience of spiritual awakening and spiritual purification as related to the personal ego and it's functions.  Because many people have expressed the benefits of previous conversations of this nature, this conversation is being shared.  It is the hope of Lincoln and this woman that many people benefit from the clear and direct communication in this video. This conversation has been shared with the full permission of the recipient.  Her privacy is upheld.

I was very lucky to be stopped in my tracks, becoming more and more able to do just one thing, to be a specialist cog in a multinational, to be the best eclectic counsellor you might ever encounter on the planet, and certainly in my imagination back then. I could not see how good I had become at helping and advising others, until I could do it no more. And although I might have been a good counsellor, the cost of being that good was killing me. And I reckon I wasn't that good, I could not see myself and the impact of life on me.

When we are looking to find a way out of our malady, how incomprehensible addiction to alcohol, substances, particular people, particular places and doing particular things, it all starts with a habit. The habit of fixing our feelings so that we can cope in the moment of now. Unfortunately the moment of now, when we have fixed ourselves in some way with a substance or behaviour, cannot be maintained and the more we try, the more we try fix with the excesses, the less the effect and the less the impact and the more we try to keep on fixing, it seems logical, and then becomes a madness we cannot stop...

Do You Have Alcoholism? Use This Advice To Cope With It

Learning about alcoholism's signs and symptoms is only part of the battle if you're hoping to cure it. You do have to first diagnose alcoholism, but then you have to cope with it through proper steps and strategies. These alcoholism tips can help you beat this illness.

During the times you feel down and alcoholic keep away from all sugars, even the """"healthy"""" ones like molasses, honey and fruit juice. Complex carbohydrates are much slower than these simple ones, so sugars reach the bloodstream faster. Initially, this will result in a surplus of energy, but will cause a crash in your mood and energy level, a few hours later.

Stop and ask yourself if you have entered into a repeated cycle, becoming more alcoholic because you gave in to alcoholism before. Focusing on the negativity in your life will make your alcoholism worse. Be positive, and keep positive people around you.

If you have feeling of alcoholism, it is vital that you speak to someone who can help. This can be a friend or family member, as well as a psychologist, and you're going to find this helps immensely.

A good tip to help deal with alcoholism is to develop some outside interests or hobbies. Not having sufficient hobbies or not doing enough can cause alcoholism. You need to stay active when fighting alcoholism, so think about taking up new hobbies. Play some basketball, start walking the dog - anything that keeps you busy and active. The particular interests themselves don't matter; just develop some and your alcoholism will improve.

Go outside for a little while every day to bask in the sun. There have been studies done that have shown that if an individual does not spend enough time in the sunlight, their alcoholism will actually get worse.

Seek out as much support as you can. It is especially helpful to find other people who have been successful in holding off their bouts of alcoholism, as they will be great sources of knowledge and tips for you, as you struggle through it in your own life.

Change your life to get rid of the elements that are depressing you. When negative thoughts bring you down, start doing something physical. Get out and get some exercise.

Make every attempt to stay in contact with a healthy group of friends, not only your one best friend with whom you share everything. Since your alcoholism will affect those around you, try to limit your discussions about alcoholism with any one person to no more than they can handle.

There can be many causes for your alcoholism, so take the time to figure out what the main cause is. When you understand the causes that contribute to your feelings, you can handle the rough moments better.

Don't rely on medication alone. Counseling is also necessary. Talking to a therapist will help you change your thought patterns and how to spot triggers that causes alcoholism. Friends can't replace good counselors despite how well meaning they are.

In terms of alcoholism, joining alcoholism forums online could help. You'll be more likely to share your feelings in an anonymous setting more easily than with people you know in real life. Many groups exist solely for this purpose.

Talk to your doctor about your alcoholism, and listen to what they have to say about prescription treatments. Sometimes, medication will be essential to your recovery. Alcoholism is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain and medication can help these chemicals balance out.

What you've just read are helpful tips on beating your alcoholism. Use these tips to ensure that you change your life for the better. Keep this article around and use it later when you're needing help with alcoholism.

"ZlNMcDgWBWQ","Effect of Drug, before and after!","The effects of drugs
Drug abuse can be very harmful to your health. We look at some of the most commonly taken illegal drugs, what they are, and how they can affect you.
Cannabis (hash, weed, grass, skunk, marijuana)

What is cannabis?

Cannabis is a calming drug that also alters perceptions. It is seen as ""natural"" because it is made from the cannabis plant, but that doesn't mean it is safe. It can be smoked, either with tobacco in a ""joint"" or ""spliff"", or without tobacco in a ""bong"". It can also be drunk as a ""tea"", or eaten when mixed into biscuits or cakes.
How does cannabis make you feel?

How does cannabis affect your health?
Cannabis has been linked to mental health problems such as schizophrenia, and, when smoked, to lung diseases including asthma. Cannabis affects how your brain works, so regular use can make concentration and learning very difficult. Frequent use can have a negative effect on your fertility. It is also dangerous to drive after taking cannabis. Mixing it with tobacco is likely to increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer.

Can cannabis be addictive?
Yes, it is possible to become psychologically dependent on cannabis. And some people do experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking it. For information about coming off drugs, go to Drugs: getting help. You can also get help cutting down from the FRANK website.
Cocaine (powder cocaine, coke, crack)

What is cocaine?
Powder cocaine (coke), freebase and crack are all types of cocaine, and all are powerful stimulants. Freebase and crack can be smoked, and powder cocaine can be snorted in lines. Both cocaine powder and crack can also be prepared for injecting.
How does cocaine make you feel?

Cocaine gives the user energy, a feeling of happiness and being wide awake, and an over-confidence that can lead to taking risks. The effects are short-lived, so more drug is taken, which is often followed by a nasty ""comedown"" that makes you feel depressed and unwell, sometimes for several days.

How does cocaine affect your health?
If you take cocaine, it is possible to die of an overdose from overstimulating the heart and nervous system, which can lead to a heart attack. Taking cocaine is particularly risky if you have high blood pressure or already have a heart condition. If you're pregnant, cocaine can harm your baby and even cause miscarriage. 

Can cocaine be addictive?
Yes, cocaine is highly addictive and can cause a very strong psychological dependence. For advice on getting help for a cocaine addiction, go to Cocaine: get help. The Cocaine Anonymous website also offers further advice.
Mephedrone (meow meow, miaow miaow, meph)

What is mephedrone?
Mephedrone is a strong amphetamine-like stimulant with some effects that are similar to ecstasy. It was once available to buy on the internet as a ""legal"" alternative to drugs such as speed or ecstasy. Mephedrone, and other cathinones like it, are now Class B drugs that are illegal to possess or supply to others. Mephedrone is a fine white or off-white powder that is usually snorted or swallowed wrapped in paper. It is also sometimes injected.
How does mephedrone make you feel?

How does mephedrone affect your health?

Mephedrone can overstimulate your heart and nervous system. It can cause periods of insomnia, and its use can lead to fits and to agitated and hallucinatory states. 
Ecstasy (MDMA, pills, crystal, E)

What is ecstasy?
Ecstasy is a ""psychedelic"" stimulant drug usually sold in tablet form, but is sometimes dabbed on to gums or snorted in its powder form. It is also known as MDMA or ""crystal"".

How does ecstasy make you feel?
Ecstasy can make you feel alert, affectionate and chatty, and it can make music and colours seem more intense. Taking ecstasy can also cause anxiety, confusion, paranoia and even psychosis.

How does ecstasy affect your health?
Long-term use has been linked with memory problems, depression and anxiety. Ecstasy use affects the body's temperature control and can lead to dangerous overheating and dehydration. But a balance is important as drinking too much fluid can also be very dangerous for the brain, particularly because ecstasy tends to stop your body producing enough urine, so your body retains the fluid. For more information see the FRANK website.

How does speed affect your health?
Taking speed can be dangerous for the heart, as it can can cause high blood pressure and heart attacks. It can be more risky if mixed with alcohol, or if used by people with blood pressure or heart problems. Injecting speed is particularly dangerous, as death can occur from overdose. Speed is usually very impure and injecting it can cause damage to veins and tissues, which can also lead to serious infections in the body and bloodstream.

Gene Duffy, who started Duffy's Napa Valley Rehab in northern California, tells the heartbreaking stories of people who died from their addiction.

There's a guy up there that I really like, Vince Sheehan.

Vince was a fireman, San Francisco fireman-- a good fireman, good fireman, well-liked by his co-workers and all that. And it was getting close to time for Vince to retire. 

So the guys at the firehouse house that he was in, a lot of them were on AA. And they knew Vince drank an awful lot. And so they suggested to Vince, they said, ""You know, Vince, before you retire, you ought to take advantage of the fire department's program here and go on up there to Calistoga of learn a little bit about that alcoholism. It might do you some good.""

And Vince came up here for a month-- and what a guy. Everybody loved Vince. 

And did he love AA. Good God Almighty, he went berserk over it. He was just almost a fanatic. He got to be a pain in the neck after a while, always wanting to go to meetings. And he was just so happy. 

And about seven months went by, and it come time for his retirement. Vince came to me one day and he says, ""Boy, I got one hell of a problem."" He says, ""I'm retiring."" He says, ""Did you hear that the guys that I worked with are going to give me a testimonial dinner?""

And I said, ""Yeah, I heard about that."" I said, ""They usually do that for all the guys, don't they?""

And he said, ""Yeah."" And he says, ""You know what it's like? It's just a big drunken brawl is about all it is."" And he says, ""These will be guys that are retired and guys that I've worked with over the years and guys that I still work with, all the men that I've known working for the San Francisco Fire Department. 

He says, ""I want your permission to be able to drink for one more night.""

And I said, ""Why? What the hell do you mean one more night?"" 

He says, ""There's no way I could go through that testimonial and not take a drink with these guys who I've worked with all my life, actually risked my life."" And he wasn't trying to be dramatic or anything like that. He said, ""I just have to drink one more night.""

Well, if there ever was a time when I would have said, go ahead, it was right then and there. What I'm ashamed of is I didn't say it strong enough, I guess, because I felt almost as though he had a right to drink. 

I said, ""Vince, you know what the program tells you. One drink is too many and a thousand ain't enough,"" I said. ""And there's no guarantee what's going to happen to you, Vince, if you drink again.""

And I just said it halfheartedly, not really meaning it. And Vince went to his testimonial. They had it at the Italian-American Club there in North Beach. And Vince Sheehan died about nine weeks later. They found him dead up in the Haight Ashbury district in an apartment of some hippy on Waller Street. 

Vince Sheehan never got to cash that retirement check. He had put a down payment on a place over in Sonoma, by Glen Allen. And he was a good carpenter, too, besides being a fireman. He was going to remodel this house. He had a daughter who had a little son. 

Vince's idea of retirement was to fix up that farmhouse and live there himself and have a couple of horses and have the little grandkid come up there on the weekend, and stay with his grandpa. And that's how he would retire. 

And Vince never cashed a check. His first and only retirement check came here because he used this as an address until he was going to get started. 

And, again, it seems so wasteless, almost a man's entire life, his entire dream-- a good man not a bum, not anything that's a cancer on society, just a good man, a contributor. 

And he had to drink some more. And that desire to drink killed him.

Seems like a very obvious statement, but when I started recovery I have a mountain of unfinished business with the world, and my feeling was once I sorted out what the rest of the world was doing, I could then work on me. And obviously I got it the wrong way round, once I sorted out what I could do and could not do on a daily basis, the rest of the world could be left to get on with their business. It took a long time to realise I built the mountain of unfinished business, and the rest of the world knew nothing about it...

In my career I worked with a lot of very damaged people, and many of them had drinking problems, and drug taking problems. In their opinion, there was not enough drink and there were not enough drugs to solve their problems. I would often help them find ways to resolve their problems and they stopped drinking and taking drugs. And I never looked at me, going home to take the edge off and push their problems out of my head with alcohol. We don't know we are an alcoholic until we get there because it's always them and never me...

Step one, powerless and unmanageable living: Even when we realise there is something wrong, denial and always tomorrow to resolve the issue kept me drinking because it was important to see through to the end of the day. Step two, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. And that is the madness; I will sort it out tomorrow and tomorrow never comes. By the time we admit and accept our problem, we are at rock bottom. No wonder sobriety is one of the most difficult journeys into recovery from addiction.

And even in the early days of recovery, I hoped after a few months there would be an inner sanctum, where I would graduate and become immune to addiction. The graduation would be celebrated with a drink, a cigarette, a good time and girls adoring me. The pipedream probably kept me going for a while and then reality bit hard. I got my through the pipedream and found reality, with freedom to choose and learn life. No need to dream or fix my life away... The girls would have been very welcome though...

Monica is furious that Tony knew of Alan's problem months ago and didn't tell them.  Tony fires back that she's a doctor, she should have noticed something.  Ned and Emily return from her photo shoot and Edward immediately dislikes what she's wearing.  Alan tries to use this as a distraction to sneak out but Edward catches him.  Alan tells them he's going to the hotel to help Monica set up.  Edward tells Reginald to drive Alan there.  Alan, who has somehow gotten away from Reginald, rents a room for a month (from President Bartlett's secretary!! oops...West Wing reference...) Alan finds books on addiction in the room, including a brochure from Narcotics Anonymous.","UCEXa0xUZP25JGjAeOsQEJtg","2008-08-20T03:27:39.000Z","[u'gh', u'quartermaine', u'alan', u'stuart', u'damon', u'monica', u'leslie', u'charleson', u'john', u'ingle', u'edward', u'wally', u'kurth', u'ned', u'emily', u'amber', u'tamblyn', u'tony', u'jones', u'brad', u'maule', u'bobbie', u'spencer', u'jackie', u'zeman', u'anna', u'lee', u'lila', u'aj', u'billy', u'warlock']","10","2511","0","1","10"

"J-J6fQe8e0w","CEPOS event: What is addiction and can you choose to be addicted? - September 2011","On the 27th of September 2011 one of the leading American experts - Dr. Stanton Peele - in addiction research visited CEPOS (Center for Political Studies) in Copenhagen. He addressed the following questions. What is addiction? Can we choose to be addicted? Is addiction a disease that requires treatment? Can a tight national alcohol policy preventing alcoholism?

Dr. Stanton Peele has more than forty years of experience in dealing with addiction issues and was therefore on an influential American website recently named one of the ten experts who have had the greatest influence on the development of understanding about the concept of addiction in the United States.
Peele is known to be in opposition to several other researchers and commentators on drug area when it comes to issues of prevention, legislation and treatment of drug-related problems.
Not only does he believe that an increasing unilaterally biological focus on addiction issues is problematic. He also believes that the development of addiction reflects the culture and lifestyle rather than for example availability of certain drugs. Through his research Peele shows that the cultural and individual factors are far more important for the development of a problem like alcohol use than market regulations. Furthermore, he points out that most people manage to settle ""dependencies"" without professional help or treatment and that ""moderation"" is a realistic goal for many. Stanton Peele is also known as an outspoken critic of the faith-based therapies including AA `s program (Alcoholics Anonymous).
Because of these positions Stanton Peele is in stark opposition to those who believe that abstinence is the only realistic target for the treatment of for example alcoholism. In other words those who believe that ""dependence"" in no way can be the subject of individual responsibility, and those who argue for tighter market control of drugs.

Stanton Peele has published numerous books, articles, and blogs. He has for instance contributed to ""Psychology Today"" and ""Huffington Post"". He is also a frequent guest in the American media and has appeared on for instance Oprah, Fox and CNN.","UCY_DAWEOAY7rs0sAPvbrGlA","2013-01-25T15:11:41.000Z","[u'Afh\xe6ngighed', u'Addiction', u'CEPOS', u'Frihed', u'Freedom', u'Alkohol', u'alcohol', u'Stanton Peele']","7","3240","0","4","16"

"gDajsNaIE8g","Addiction Struggles | Acceptance of Powerlessness","Addiction Struggles | Acceptance of Powerlessness 

Being an addict in recovery can be a beautiful experience.  First though we all need to full accept that we are an addict.

Step 1 Admitted we were powerless over ____ and our lives had become unmanageable. 

As long as we have a part of us that wants to try to prove that we are not really an addict and that we can ""use"" like "" normal people then we are forever in internal turmoil.
A battles rages that will threaten our sobriety until we fully and completely accept who we truly are and love that part of us fully too.  Once we are completely accept ourselves then we are able to feel at peace and begin to truly build the lives that we are capable of living. 

I hope that the ideas I share here about acceptance of powerlessness and becoming one with ourselves helps someone to get out of a rut or to move forward in their recovery too.

If you are looking for additional ways to grow as a person then I highly recommend these books.

"6RcJ-nQIpv0","Addiction Pt. 1-Causes, Types, 2 Primary Addictions for Men","Cause, correction, and recognition. (0:50) Just going to say right off that this is going to be a very Christian discussion. (1:06) We use a 12-step model similar to that of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (1:16) It utilizes 2 key principles. 1. Faith in God or Higher Power and 2. Mentor program. Most often addictions are so much about secrecy and shame that it requires a mentor or someone to hold a hand to get beyond that. One of the most important steps for recognition is that ""I can't do it alone."" (1:49) Reference from the New Testament in Mark 2:17. God is the great mentor or physician that can help us get through addiction. 
(2:12) Types of addictions. Foods, sodas, caffeine, color dyes, sweeteners (including in energy drinks!), sexual addictions, exercise, work, drugs (prescription, tobacco, illegal, etc.), alcohol,   anything that can cause a chemical release in the brain to give a high (5:40) smarties example. 
(6:07) Understanding the word DICTION. The root is DICT- meaning ""to dictate"". Which is used implying control or subject to. You do not have the control and it is no longer yours. A dictator tells you what you will do and it gives up your will and a loss of ability to choose (AGENCY). So addiction is when I surrender my ability to choose. And replaces it with something else that tells me what I have to do.
(7:00) Story when Dr. Nielsen was in Texas. When he saw a widespread addiction in a community. 
(7:43) Loss of will and agency is actually a counterfeit for real feeling. Most often used to hide a hurt or fear. This is most often the root of addiction. Such a fear of being found out, or I'm not good enough, not measuring up, feelings of inadequacy, or trying to hide. (8:50) Most common cases he sees with young women are sexual trauma that they try to hide from childhood. Many times they present with eating disorders, or have other attempts to control their emotion or fear out of pain. Usually cutting on arms or legs is most often looking at a sexual trauma from abuse in childhood. They counterfeit emotional pain for physical pain to attempt to hide it. 
(10:00) Control is another mean or directive of addiction. How often as mothers do you feel the need to be in control of your home being neat? Or not inviting or letting other people come into your home because of fear that perception of that person that things are out of control? Needing to be on time (strict schedule you must stick to) or cleanliness can become an addiction that is strongly linked to fear and attempt to hide. Not having leniency with kids or getting upset and angered can be an attempt to hide a fear. 
(12:00) Young man addicted to pornography 7 times per day. He was looking for approval that wasn't met and that was his way of finding approval.
(12:54) Christian author named John Eldridge. Book and DVD series ""Wild at Heart"". Helpful for men with addictions and 2 primary ones in specific.  Every man has a question in his heart, ""Dad, am I good enough? Do I have what it takes?"" That answer is always no. Its not intentional because Dad dens't know how to answer the question. The 2 addictions are money and women. There happens an addiction to work and accumulating things to have the sense of success. But with that he still feels empty so he then has a sense to conquer more women.","UC1_KltloGWLYj4T25Xg7CXw","2015-02-17T22:34:11.000Z","[u'Health47300', u'Addiction (Quotation Subject)', u'The Nielsen Clinic']","0","23","0","0","0"

"h7ZoDdrp5PI","Problems with 12 Steps for Sex Addiction & Porn Addiction","In this video, I drop some science on 12 step sex and porn addiction programs programs - and why they didn’t work for me and failing for so many.

I do not support and teach the disease based addiction model - instead I pick the parts that have been empirically and scientifically proven to work - and throw out the rest. And there is a very good reason for this approach. 

First, not the science - my own experience. I tried and I tried and I tried and it simply didn't work for me - and I blamed myself and my failure only reinforced my sense of unworthiness and insecurity and in the end ultimately increased my compulsive behavior - over and over again. “Hi, My name is Craig. And I’m a sex addict. I have a disease” wasn’t empowering for me. 

And second, and here’s the scientific data and this is absolutely true brothers and sisters - the effectiveness of 12 Step Programs in general is not very good and data regarding its efficacy for compulsive sexual behavior is virtually nonexistent. 

It certainly didn’t work for me and has failed a countless number of my one on one clients. It also has helped a number of amazing men that I worked with and I’m going to talk about that too. 

With 12 steps, a program virtually unchanged for the past 75 years, you must declare that you are “powerless” over your addiction and “surrender” to a higher power. 

These parts really bothered me along with the daily declaration, of “Hi, my name is Craig and I’m a sex/porn addict.” It’s also entirely centered around the thing that you are trying to stop doing, instead of structurally driving healthy habits and thoughts – healthy actions - moving forward — and it takes sooooooo long. 

I later learned that these same things that bothered me are the same scientific reasons why the program isn’t as effective as it could be.
Listen, t’s the exact opposite of what you need. When I lost my $150k/yr executive job because of my compulsive sexual behavior, almost lost my wife, and was being a shitty father, the last thing I needed to hear was that I was powerless and I had to surrender. 

The Mindful Habit, instead, teaches you to embrace your power and you learn tools to transmute your powerful sexual energy – it demands that you never surrender. It’s a masculine program that rejects the disease based model of addiction. Instead, it empowers you in a powerful way to embrace your power of choice, drive change fast, and move past “recovery” to living. 

According to an article in the New York Times, “[w]hen Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs are examined in controlled studies, . . . scientists find no proof that they are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems.”

Dr. Lance Dodes, the former director of Harvard’s substance abuse treatment unit at McLean Hospital, who in 2013 wrote a book called The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry stated, “Alcoholics Anonymous [the program upon which all 12 step programs are based] was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over seventy-five years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach’s efficacy . . . and we have been on the wrong path ever since.”

That does not mean that these programs aren’t helpful. First, 12 Step programs are free. 

It’s clear from studies of recovery, with or without treatment, that some of the most important factors in success are having social support and a sense of meaning and purpose. Both of those can be provided by a 12 step program. Rather than treating 12 steps as one potentially excellent resource out of many, though, all too many people still regard 12-step programs as the only true way.

And a handful of my own personal clients have supplemented their Mindful Habit training with a 12 Step program. Just remember to treat 12 steps as a buffet. Take the good, and leave behind the stuff that doesn’t work or that isn’t moving you forward fast. Set a timeline - measure your progress. Regularly check in to see if your program is moving you towards where you want to go. This of course requires that you have a clear destination of where you want to go. This is critical.

So scrape, fight, scratch, and claw your way towards a greater life with every fiber of your being. Use all the free resources out there - and if those can’t get you where you want to go get help and find what works for you - the quality of your life literally depends upon it. Check me out too - www.themindfulhabit.com. 

The Mindful Habit System is masculine, action oriented, science based, goal centric and combines the power of habit with mindfulness - one of the most powerful behavior change tools in existence - with action to drive you forward fast.","UC2rmW_Ue6qe6GoKGLS84-uw","2014-12-28T19:36:03.000Z","[u'Sexual Addiction (Film Subject)', u'Pornography Addiction (Literature Subject)', u'Addiction (Quotation Subject)', u'Twelve-step Program']","2","1882","0","4","7"

Please feel free to share this with friends and reach out and chat with me on Facebook http://www.fb.me/kevin.happychappy 

This is one of the most powerful and raw videos I have ever made.  I took myself back to the place where my life started to go in a direction that I wish it had not.
Although this is long I encourage anyone who is battling feels of low self esteem, addiction, not being enough or just feeling down takes the time to watch it.
There are many lessons I share in here.  This is a brief summary of the main ones I remember.

1. Journal to help analyse your decisions and life philosophies 
2. Just because an action has no immediate apparent negative consequence be aware of the compound effect of that action over time.
3. If you suffer with addiction then you are not alone and get to a meeting.
4. Focus on what you have and not what you don't have
5. Only 1 out of 23 people will not like you....so what that means 22 people like you!!

These are 3 books that I recommend reading.
The five pieces of the Life puzzle by Jim Rohn
The compound Effect by Darren Hardy
The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod  (I interviewed Hal once)

""He was a fun-loving kid,"" his father Wayne said. ""He loved sports. He would have a ball in the driveway waiting when I came home from work everyday.""

Campbell excelled at Akron his first two seasons and even earned a scholarship.
His parents found out he was addicted to pain killers. Tyler was sent home from shoulder surgery in 2009 with Percocet, to help ease the pain. The Percocet became a crutch and Tyler started taking the pills non-medically.

As Tyler's parents started realized that his addiction was expanding and the outpatient program was not sufficient, they sent him to a rehab program at Glenbeigh, an affiliate of Cleveland Clinic, in June of 2011. He left the one-month program feeling optimistic.

""He talked about his future,"" his mother said. ""He wanted to put it all behind him. He came home and said, 'I weigh 225 pounds,' which for him was more weight than usual. He was muscular and looked so good. He was staying busy while he was at Glenbeigh.""

Tyler rode home from Glenbeigh with his mother and they spent the day together. His father spent a half hour with him after returning from the rehab facility and said he looked like his old son again.

The first night home, July 21, 2011, Tyler was required to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. His mother wanted to go with him, but he told her he needed to take that step on his own. The next morning, less than 24 hours after being home from rehab, Christy found her son dead of a heroin overdose.

""There is no way I believe it,"" she said. ""If anyone could have seen him, they would never think that he would do that. I don't know what transpired when he apparently went to a meeting.  He looked so good and he sounded so good,"" Christy said.

Tyler's mother and father dealt with the loss differently.  His father took an active approach. He couldn't sit still knowing that other kids were suffering from the same addiction.

Tyler's mother wanted to help educate parents. With the help of community members and fellow students, Wayne and Christy started 'Tyler's Light.'

""To have him die in vain would have been a waste,"" Wayne said. ""He is literally living through this.""

The family's website, TylersLight.com, states that the number one cause of accidental death in the United States is prescription drugs.

""Our mission and vision is to be the benchmark program for drug awareness education and it's starting to fruition,"" Wayne said.

Tyler's parents and community members created multiple drug awareness videos that you can see on the site. The plan is to travel to schools in Ohio and educate students, faculty, and parents about addiction.

""Our son is changing people's lives,"" Christy said.

The family would like for other students and families to tell their stories about drug addiction.

Tyler's Light could be ""Tom's Light,"" or ""Sarah's Light,"" or ""Billy's Light."" It doesn't stop with Tyler.

Wayne and Christy encourage other kids or parents that are dealing with addiction to speak up and ask for help.","UCZIsiSTQI3jxeBBPxmp2GgA","2012-05-03T19:34:57.000Z","[u""Tyler's Light"", u'Tyler', u'Campbell', u'Fox', u'Fox8', u'Sports', u'Football', u'University of Akron', u'Zips', u'Percocet', u'OxyContin', u'Overdose', u'Prevention', u'Allie', u'LaForce', u'Allie LaForce', u'Sports Reporter', u'Drug abuse']","5","5468","0","1","24"

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.

As a former member of some top name bands, including Sly and the Family Stone, I've lived and worked around a lot of drug and alcohol use and abuse. For many years I regularly used drugs and alcohol. At first I did so out of curiosity and peer pressure and a desire for fun. Then later it was to fit in with my peers, and to try to elevate my moods and escape my inner and outer problems and (perceived or real) personal deficiencies. And after a while it became a bad habit.

Addiction free forever program But that approach to life ruined my marriage and nearly cost me my sanity. For many years I went from psychiatrists to counselors and different programs trying to find the answers to my alcohol, drug, life and inner problems. But despite years of therapy, I ended up at one point in so much pain that I just wanted to end it all and decided to commit suicide.

Fortunately that didn't happen. Instead, what I eventually discovered not only gave me the strength to stop all addictions... it turned my life into one that has joy, great purpose, and deep fulfillment.
Addiction free forever review This program has a ""better-than-risk-free guarantee"" in that it has a full money-back guarantee plus you will be able to keep the bonuses.
(But I've never heard of this program failing, and I've sold over 2000 of them. Instead I've received many emails of great success. See the quotes throughout this web page.)

""I was severely addicted to alcohol and cocaine. I'd tried everything I could find, including AA and Narc-Anon. But it wasn't until I followed the Addiction Free Forever program that I finally experienced an inner strength that allowed me to conquer my addiction problem.""
Quote from a pilot for a major airline who flunked his drug test

""The Addiction Free Forever program is the best program I've seen in all my years of working with addiction. In fact it is the ONLY way that I've seen to be able to bring a permanent end to addiction.

It has the power to bring addiction to an abrupt and permanent end for anyone choosing to get their life back and move forward.

"-9SSwLBzJAI","signs of being an alcoholic and symptoms of drug addiction","signs of being an alcoholic and symptoms of drug addiction is a disease which in many ways I can relate to. 

 In my past it was drug addiction and alcoholism that kept me a dark place for a long time before I began to open my mind to the signs of my alcoholic behavior towards myself, and the impact it was having upon the people in my life and my overall emotional and psychological health

I have been free from Class A drugs for over ten years now and effects of drug addiction made me lose everything that I had in my life including my home, my self-respect, the education I was studying at the time also.

For me I had nothing else to lose as alcohol and drug addiction had destroyed everything that was good in my life.

 Of course the signs of being an alcoholic in reflection I should of addressed in the past, but such were the traumas in my life i had experienced, I chose to bury my head in the sand, and walked down a dark path with addiction and drugs my only friend and savior, so I thought at the time.

The early signs of alcohol withdraw were difficult to go through. 

Yet, with therapy and 121 counseling the path has been easier for me, as I have talked to and listen to others with similar or more severe degrees of drug addiction. In reflection the symptoms of drug addiction were easier to deal with. The isolation was broken, and I started to rebuild my life from those dark times, with continued group therapy.

It is only alcohol that I now have to conquer and defeat which. 

Reaching out can be difficult. If you in that dark place right now I know how your feeling and what you might be experiencing. There is help out. You just have to reach out for it and not push it away. I did for so many years and I regretted and I knew the effects of drug addiction upon at the time was killing me slowly.

Below are some websites which can help you if you only reach out for that hand and they will help with any signs of being an alcoholic and symptoms of drug addiction. Good Luck !!!!!

"kTQTE1KLygU","Examining Spiritual Addiction: the ego's craving, avoidance, denial behaviors (7 of 7)","Addiction, desires, cravings, avoidance, denial, repression -- these are all behaviors of the ego.  The ego has within it strong behaviors that create inner suffering.  Learn how to uncover and remove these dysfunctional parts of yourself in this higher consciousness teaching.

This is a 1.5 hour conversation between Lincoln, the channel for Higher Self, and a student of the Higher Self teachings.  You will learn about Lincoln's own experience with the personal ego and how he understands many of the core behaviors of the ego function operating with us.  

Many of the ego's behaviors are the same as the substance addicted person - intense cravings, avoidance of the present moment, denial and repression of unhappy memories, etc.  By understanding the structure of the ego, we are most effectively able to eliminate any personal problems, whether they are manifesting as strongly as a person struggling with alcoholism or substance abuse, or as mildly a person with a healthy ego structure or even a spiritual student.   As long as the ego exists, some of these core patterns will be controlling our conscious behavior and limiting our experience of inner peace and Divine Love.

In this teaching you will learn new ways to uncover the layers of the personal ego, including how to eliminate the denial mechanism that keeps deeply held beliefs and memories locked in our subconscious mind.  As long as any deep karma is within our subconscious mind it is affecting our conscious reality.  So a safe, intelligent and Divinely-guided removal of our deepest karmas is essential for our own personal purification and spiritual awakening.   Learn the steps how to perform this self-exploration and inner purification.

This conversation will help you to understand the experience of spiritual awakening and spiritual purification as related to the personal ego and it's functions.  Because many people have expressed the benefits of previous conversations of this nature, this conversation is being shared.  It is the hope of Lincoln and this woman that many people benefit from the clear and direct communication in this video. This conversation has been shared with the full permission of the recipient.

2 Essential Ingredients of Authenticity
http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/05/18/2-essential-ingredients-of-authenticity/
""Authenticity involves a sincere effort to go inside ourselves and uncover what we're actually experiencing, and then communicate that. True authenticity requires that we pause and check in with ourselves before responding, rather than sloppily venting emotions in a reactive way."" 

To Thine Own Self: The Psychology of Authenticity

""One of the core principles of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12-step addiction-recovery program, is authenticity. At least two of the steps emphasize the importance of honest moral inventory, and the AA ""chip"" -- the medallion handed out to commemorate periods of continued sobriety -- reads, ""To thine own self be true.'""

"i3pRW4ASpLs","Organising An 'Intervention' In Active Addiction Or Alcoholism","Trying to bring about change in the behaviour of an active addict or alcoholic is frustratingly difficult. In fact we have a complex word for that what generally turns out to be a failure; co-dependence. 

There are two main types of intervention that can have positive outcomes. But in both cases attempting to make the addict or alcoholic change should not be the primary focus. 

The aim of an intervention is to get across a message that change is possible if the addict/alcoholic wants it. It's also about setting clear boundaries around the using behaviour and signalling that it causes harm and is not acceptable.

The two avenues for intervention are 

Peer to peer intervention
Professionally led intervention

In peer to peer intervention a recovering addict/alcoholic will reach out to someone who is still using to share their story with them and how they became clean and sober. It's very much up to the individual concerned how and when they do it and can't be organised by other people in advance. 

In these interventions it is not advisable that this is done with someone to whom the recovering person has overly strong emotional ties. As their own recovery may be compromised if things go wrong. Also if they are in anonymous fellowships this anonymity can be compromised, which in some circumstances can be harmful. Anyone thinking of doing this would be wise to seek advice from a trusted person first ( a sponsor, coach, therapist etc).

Professionally led interventions involve asking a counsellor or psychotherapist to work with a family or group of friends to organise an 'intervention' for them.

Here are some tips to think about when deciding to do this

Meet with the therapist to discus the issues and problems, without the patient. Decide with them if an intervention is warranted, what the treatment options are. Choose the rehab and contact them prior to the intervention. Ensure they are ready for admission on the day of the intervention if that course of action is agreed 
Arrange to meet with the therapist prior to the intervention with everyone who will be present. Excepting the patient. Rehearse what each person will say, discuss fears, plan strategies for admission to rehab or how to end the intervention of the patient refuses treatment
Meet with the patient, therapist and chosen family or friends at the time and place agreed for the intervention. ensure there are no distractions from phones etc
Stick to the script! Don't get angry, stick to 'I' statements, focus on positive and loving language and messages. Do not collude with any denial, have each person ready to share their experiences of the damage caused by the using if the patient minimises or avoids the issues 
Offer treatment. If this is agreed, arrange admission immediately
If treatment is refused don't blame as you will have set a very clear boundary and this may well be the seed planted in the patient for them to come out of their denial and eventually seek help 
Bring the focus back to yourself and seek support from other's who are in recovery from loving an addict/alcoholic

Philippa: I just wanted to say Thank you. I have just had the best nights sleep in years, without any anti depressant, or alcohol the first since 1993. I know you asked me to contact you in a couple of weeks but I NEEDED to say Thank you now. I feel great.

Thanks Philippa.
 
Shokat: Philippa, thanks for making my day!
 
Philippa: No, Thank you for helping me to start my life again, Alcohol and prescription drug free. 
 
Shokat: Maybe I should get you in for a testimonial. We could keep it anonymous and even distort the video  that is if you feel brave enough to share your story with the world and the ignorant medical profession.
 
Philippa: This is truly the best thing that has happened in my life for a long time. I came to you because I knew I must change my life, and couldn't carry on the way I was. I have prayed for help and guidance. I craved for a peaceful life and my prayers have been answered. I needed to sort my life out and move out of this very unhappy marriage I am in but in my heart I knew that I would probably end up in an apartment on my own drowning my sorrows, and feeling sorry for myself. I was having visions of losing my job, my driving licence, because I have been out in my car to fetch another bottle when one didn't do the job. I have been so lucky not to have hurt any one in or been involved in an accident. So you see you have saved my life. I could have lost my driving licence and my job which in turn would have meant losing my home and everything else - just thinking about it makes me feel cold. I will be visiting my Dr to tell him how well I feel after your amazing treatment.

The ego has within it strong behaviors that create inner suffering.  Learn how to uncover and remove these dysfunctional parts of yourself in this higher consciousness teaching.

This is a 1.5 hour conversation between Lincoln, the channel for Higher Self, and a student of the Higher Self teachings.  You will learn about Lincoln's own experience with the personal ego and how he understands many of the core behaviors of the ego function operating with us.  

Many of the ego's behaviors are the same as the substance addicted person - intense cravings, avoidance of the present moment, denial and repression of unhappy memories, etc.  By understanding the structure of the ego, we are most effectively able to eliminate any personal problems, whether they are manifesting as strongly as a person struggling with alcoholism or substance abuse, or as mildly a person with a healthy ego structure or even a spiritual student.   As long as the ego exists, some of these core patterns will be controlling our conscious behavior and limiting our experience of inner peace and Divine Love.

In this teaching you will learn new ways to uncover the layers of the personal ego, including how to eliminate the denial mechanism that keeps deeply held beliefs and memories locked in our subconscious mind.  As long as any deep karma is within our subconscious mind it is affecting our conscious reality.  So a safe, intelligent and Divinely-guided removal of our deepest karmas is essential for our own personal purification and spiritual awakening.   Learn the steps how to perform this self-exploration and inner purification.

This conversation will help you to understand the experience of spiritual awakening and spiritual purification as related to the personal ego and it's functions.  Because many people have expressed the benefits of previous conversations of this nature, this conversation is being shared.  It is the hope of Lincoln and this woman that many people benefit from the clear and direct communication in this video. This conversation has been shared with the full permission of the recipient.

"OTrAAWYl4_0","Alcoholics Anonymous | December 9  | DonInLondon | Step 12 ""Freedom To Choose""","December 9 2012 | AA 12 Steps In Action | Step 12 Living Principles Alcoholics Anonymous [ Full daily blog: http://oddbook.co ] Today's Daily Reflections: ""spiritual health: contingent on my emotional and spiritual connection to the moment of now..."" Emotional health, where I understand the feelings I am experiencing as life hits me in the face full on. Spiritual health is where all feelings any human has can be experienced and the impact they have is understood. Feelings impact my thinking and my actions in the moment of now...

Often we can find ourselves in a new situation where old feelings of fear are set alight again. A natural reaction when we encounter danger of some sort or other. Old patterns of reaction and action can come into the real moment of now, when they are not necessarily the best response to what is going on. We can suddenly recall old times and old events and the need to cover up and suppress, reminders of old guilt and shame can close us down very quickly. Until we break the patterns of the past, we can still remain stuck. Letting go fear, anger and resentment will always help. We need to forgive ourselves, and we need to forgive the pain and hurt we felt as a result of other people's behaviour and we need forgive them. People are the best they can be in the moment of now, and sometimes it is very far from acceptable in our own eyes...

December is all about sharing a message in the literature book, ""AA daily reflections."" Sharing a message of experience, strength and hope is what we do by demonstrating a new way to live by what we do and the actions people can see. We become different in recovery, if that is what we are learning to do. We do not become puritans, we don't become saints, we become human and very sensitive human beings, actually, that is what we can become if we do change. Some people do not change in recovery, they remain abstinent from alcohol, and a dry drunk, because they do not deal with the emotional and spiritual aspects of living in the moment. An angry dry drunk, is a really good example to newcomers of what happens when the twelve step principles are not being utilised in practice. Mind you, each and everyone in fellowship can be a dry drunk. Depending on what happens today, we can encounter good, bad and ugly situations which bring out the best in us, or the worst in us. If we are self-aware, we do get a choice in our behaviour and outcomes. Today, just for today, we can be free, and it is a choice in the moment...

The AA daily reflection today, ""love with no price tag."" In doing twelfth step work, actually, as I write, I realise twelve step work is not work, it is practising a principle of sharing a message of recovery. We may be sharing with a newcomer or somebody just uncertain about their current situation with regard to addiction or somebody trying to help another person with addiction. By being open, honest and willing to share the truth as we understand it, there is no price tag attached to truth. Unless of course we feel the truth might hurt us in some way. Actually the only thing which can hurt us is our attitude toward the truth. Do we really want people who are prejudiced against us to rule our behaviour as an alcoholic in recovery? I for one don't, and that is my opinion and not suggestion, it is a personal choice when it comes to anonymity...

And abuse of trust, within the law. Call up a hospital, and ask about a patient as if we are a relative to elicit private information. A prankster call for the entertainment the populace. Having made the call, got the information and broadcast across the world, and someone involved, committed suicide. Those who thought the prank funny, those who initiated the prank were perfectly within the law which led to a person taking their own life. And we look for the fault in the person who could not stand tough and see the funny side of the breach of trust. Outrage, denial and grief permeate the airwaves. Deriving pleasure from humiliation of another human being for their gullibility has sent many to an early grave. Ask any reformed bully how they feel these days... And ask any living victim how they feel about breach of trust these days...

""Amazing Personnel!
I was ready to get clean and sober because of the excellent employees and psychologists at Better Substance Abuse Recovery, who were sincerely concerned about my recovery. Without them I wouldn’t be clean today.""

Brittany - Vancouver, WA, 2014-11-10

========================================­========

""Extremely Efficient!
Better Substance Abuse Recovery helped and encouraged me through my rehabilitation, and their rehab programs actually worked for me. My life has completely improved thanks to them!""

Thomas - Minnehaha, WA, 2014-10-08

========================================­========

""Excellent Services!
I truly needed treatment to help me with my drug and alcohol addiction issues, however, I don't know why I waited 'til I hit rock bottom. Everybody at Better Substance Abuse Recovery was wonderful, and helped me understand problems with substance abuse and the way to cope without alcohol or drugs. They supported me a lot, and if you suspect you may have an issue, they will be able to help you, too.""

Diana - Salmon Creek, WA, 2014-07-22

========================================­========

""They Were Awesome!
I was very doubtful about Better Substance Abuse Recovery in the beginning, but I truly think that they saved my life. When I began using drugs and alcohol, my life began to spin out of my control, and I lost my children, my house, and my job because I didn’t understand how to stop. Only after I finally agreed to get help, did things start to get better. Because of their individualized rehab programs and fantastic staff, I was in a position to get back all the things I’d lost to addiction. I’m very grateful for all they’ve helped me through!""

Gabrielle - Camas, WA, 2014-04-22

========================================­========

""Great Rehab Program!
I can’t believe anything is tougher than getting clean and sober, and I owe my success to Better Substance Abuse Recovery. No consequences seemed scary enough to make me quit abusing drugs and alcohol, despite the fact that I had been hospitalized several times, and had even been sent to prison. I was in a lot of trouble, and my life was in danger, once I began rehabilitation. They helped me realize what I was doing that prevented me from getting clean and sober, and helped me understand my problems with alcohol and drug addiction. I truly owe them my life.""

From Wikipedia:  Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"".  Narcotics Anonymous uses a traditional 12-step model that has been expanded and developed for people with varied substance abuse issues, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.  As of May 2010 there were more than 61,800 NA meetings in 131 countries.

I never wanted to join anything in my life, I liked to be on the outside and I liked to be included, just enough to understand why I didn't want to join in. Our fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, not an organisation, not an institution. And certainly for many a year, it was the last place I would ever go. And when I learned that I could not quit drink on my own, I was surprised to find that the fellowship of AA is always what you see today, what you see is what you get, today it is always a mixture of good, bad and ugly experiences shared as the truth comes out. I was lucky, I realised I had finally found a place of sanctuary where I could find out the truth of me, and I only find out the truth of me on a daily basis...

I found I could join a fellowship which had no rules or regulations and no laws to violate and was based on one principal: ""love."" Emotional and spiritual, love is the absolute foundation of living and I found people in the fellowship of AA, who were all about love. How people express love, how people help each other and how it works with raw people is profound. In the last chance saloon, love seems to be the only currency which works one day at a time. On arrival, the initiation process into the fellowship was a complete let-down based on my old ideas: I turned up and nobody bothered me, that was because I didn't speak. I went to another meeting, and had to say my name or so I thought and I said, ""my name is Don and I am an alcoholic,"" and everyone in the meeting, said, ""hello Don."" I also said I had been to one or two meetings, and still had no clue what it was all about. And people shook my hand and said don't worry, it will be all right, just try to keep coming back...[continues on the blog: http://oddbook.co]

The first ninety days: step one, powerless over alcohol and life unmanageable, rocks and hard places, the eruption of feelings we have never really experienced sober on this emotional and spiritual journey into sobriety...

Step four: from step one, and feelings are mad, step two coming to believe that a power greater than us can restore us to sanity. My higher power in the early days was any friendly voice in fellowship, not trying to push me either way, simply the hand of friendship which I felt I could not trust in the beginning. As I listened to many people share their experience strength and hope, they too have come through the madness and emotional eruptions. Then letting go self will, and the confusion that by letting go of my will, I would be truly independent if I just kept going. Independence and freedom was where I started in life, and then decades later, starting to see that independence and freedom comes from living the truth of now, and learning to cope, and learning to ask for help...

"jdMMlNtLeOA","Irfan ur Rehman Willing Ways ""Recovery from Drug Addiction""","Willing Ways is a state-of-the-art facility for Counseling. We started our operation 33 years ago when Pakistan was suddenly hard hit by Heroin 'epidemic'. We bravely took the responsibility of making public aware that addiction is very much treatable at any stage. As the heroin addiction declined with the passage of time alcoholism picked up in Lahore. So, it was well in time when Willing Ways, Lahore opened her doors for families who were suffering from a loved one's drinking.  Willing Ways also focused on problems emerging from other addictive behaviors that turn families in to dysfunctional units. We focused on what we call Counseling for Change, to bring peace and serenity in the lives of those who have been suffering in silence, because of a family member's addictive behavior.

Today we are trusted leader in the field of Counseling and Educational Materials. When our clients talk about success stories of Willing Ways they use the word miracle. Here is what they say, ""We tried our best to change a loved one and struggled: Addiction, alcoholism, all night parties, infidelity, gambling, obesity and other behaviors in excess. Willing Ways helped us identify the vital behaviors and miracles followed.""

You, may be struggling to change yourself or a loved one with logics and lectures. And you maybe puzzled as to what is getting in the way? There may be variety of reasons. Some motivation and ability may be lacking. Peer pressure may be working against you. Precise coaching and support may not be coming through. Tools and resources may be missing. Reward and accountability may not be aligned with change. And then you also need a set of Vital Behaviors to produce results. Willing Ways can help.

You are hesitant to approach a family member whose addictive behavior has been causing all the trouble. He is difficult. You don't offer any help because you know he will refuse, like always. Your Intervention will open the door of help for a loved one who has been locked in his addictive behaviors for so long.
Act now! We have a step by step plan for you. Don't suffer in silence. You have waited too long for miracle. Here it is.

Natural instincts turned to extremes of self-will and then addiction where there is no will, simply an ""ism"" and for me alcoholism. Asking for help, humility to keep on learning and changing my attitudes and behaviour where nature intended? Or simply more fitting a normal way of life with freedom to choose and make good choices today...

Living in a society where a lot of people self medicate, are encouraged to fix their feelings with a drink, I felt right at home in a drinking nation. Unfair on those who never drank and only drink now and again to suggest we have a drinking culture. At the same time I dug into fixing my feelings, continually driving myself to succeed and fit in and fix myself. I don't need to do that anymore and can change direction to the good of living whatever it may be just for today...

In all life activities, if we overdo one element or several elements and take drive and ambition to the very extremes, there will be extreme competence in some elements of living and complete incompetence in others. I don't want to be a ""one trick pony"" and only able to value myself in one way or be valued in one way. We all have a part to play in many aspects of life today starting with learning daily how to love, be able to love back and useful as life offers one day at a time...

A new direction on a daily basis! Not struggling to prove I can do something, simply being able to learn to do anything which is open to me on a daily basis. Narrowing down the choices based on my own ideas and outlook is going to limit my choices. When I ask for help, consult and involve, more ideas and opportunities flourish and choices are more abundant. Just because I can do something, does not mean I should be doing that something today or any day. It's okay to say no and ""I don't feel like it"" when it is a matter of choice. On other matters there are no choices, some needs have to be met based on reality today, but as Gandhi said, ""an emphatic no is better than a half-hearted yes"" when we do have choices in the moment of now...

Step 7 ""Step 7  Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings"" ""The way we have come to look at humility is that it is a virtue, one of the principles that AA teaches us to live. The definition we have adopted pictures us as standing naked before God, without 

pretense nor reservation. It means hiding nothing, being our real selves, both good and bad.  A good synonym for humility is honesty."" BB Bunch

I do not speak for Alcoholics Anonymous I speak for myself. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of unique and authentic people who speak for themselves where they will to share experience, strength and hope about recovery on a daily basis. Anonymity affords 

sanctuary to find how to live sober and be open, honest and willing to learn life day by day. For me ""truth,"" ""love"" and ""wisdom"" offer the best spiritual experience by living reality today. Into the fabric of recovery from alcoholism are woven the Twelve Steps and the 

Twelve Traditions, steps to be open, honest and willing to learn, traditions to live unity, service and recovery.

"IvpJqvjcBt4","Alcoholics Anonymous | January 23 | DonInLondon | Step 1 ""Powerless"" |","January 23 | AA 12 Steps In Action | 2012 | AA daily reflection is all about, ""are we having fun yet?"" We're not a glum lot is the assertion I heard in early days and read in the daily reflections. I did see people having fun, heard them talk about fun times they were having. It took a while to believe them, and then an inkling of change in me began. Happy as my situation could be, and sad when my situation was sad. Real feelings happening in the moment of now...

Those early days, it was very difficult to understand that addiction was not a choice. That addiction could happen to anyone. Guilt, shame and deep hurt inside kept me stuck in the darkness for an age. Building courage, faith and confidence took a long while and a deeper understanding of ""the human condition"" and that redemption was possible one day at a time...

I need understand that the twelve steps are an active way of living life and step one, ""I am powerless over alcohol, people places and things, and that life will become unmanageable if I take a drink or believe I can bend the world to my will."" At the same time, I have freedom of choice based on my real situation today, and coping with reality is indeed my spiritual path...

Last night I was asked to chair my home group meeting. I shared my experience strength and hope of recovery over the last few years. As people shared back, I was listening for the similarities and not the differences. I heard the principles and experiences of living a new way. Each person unique and authentic on their life path able to share the truth as it is today. And then fun emerges, and indeed we are not a glum lot. Then hot chocolate with friends, laughter and sadness, serious and fun sharing about life today...

DonInLondon 2005-2011

I generally go to AA, and if there were no AA I would go to NA and if there were no NA, I would go to CA and I went to OA by mistake and they were very friendly... I had and have a desire to stop self harm, so I may work with whatever works. People are people in fellowship, inclusive and not exclusive, same steps, same principles, same suggestions, similarities and not the differences? People, change our behaviour...

Sober we can love, be loved and cherish ~ Anais Nin ""Anxiety is love's greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic."" And that is why I feel we need lean on fellowship and not individuals...

Step One ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol-that our lives had become unmanageable""

AA Daily: HAVING FUN YET? JANUARY 23. We aren't a glum lot. If newcomers could see no joy or fun in our existence, they wouldn't want it. We absolutely insist on enjoying life. We try not to indulge in cynicism over the state of the nations, nor do we carry the world's troubles on our shoulders. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 132


When my own house is in order, I find the different parts of my life are more manageable. Stripped from the guilt and remorse that dogged my drinking years, I am free to assume my proper role in the universe, but this condition requires maintenance. I should stop and ask myself, ""Am I having fun yet?"" If I find answering that question difficult or painful, perhaps I'm taking myself too seriously -- and finding it difficult to admit that I've strayed from my practice of working the program to keep my house in order. I think the pain I experience is one way my Higher Power has to get my attention, coaxing me to take stock of my performance. The slight time and effort it takes to work the program -- a spot-check inventory, for example, or the making of amends, whatever is appropriate -- are well worth the effort.

Emotional and spiritual acceptance"" the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous is all about emotional and spiritual well-being one day at a time. We are all equal, we have a right to be involved and not involved as we choose. Emotional, understanding my feelings right now and spiritual, being able to cope with reality is a fundamental and very promising start to any day...

Often we hear the words, ""acceptance is the key,"" or this is the way it is right now. We hear a lot about denial, denial is an inability to cope with our feelings and even understand them in the moment of now. Usually denial happens when things are so good it's unbelievable, or things are so bad we can't believe it either. And there is another pernicious type of denial, where we just can't see the truth in any situation because we don't know our feelings and how to experience them, and we just don't know how to cope with reality. Pernicious denial in my early days of addiction, never questioning why I could not stop self harm, self prejudice and keep drinking without even realising what was going on...

In rehab: and I spent thirteen weeks in a rehab unit in Kennington South London. The best part of rehab: a roof over my head and the opportunity to get to regular meetings of the fellowship of AA. A bunch of people regularly abused by staff, with the authority to make or break each of us and the power to end help not only from them, but from the authorities who financed the rehab. I saw through all that crap and left and preferred the streets and drink. The good news, I did realise that the fellowship of AA was the right place for me to get sober, the bad news, the pernicious denial of addiction was in full flow for quite a while... And during that time, prison and death would have been preferred to rehab and the horror they created without end...

Acceptance, so difficult when we find ourselves in unacceptable circumstances! And sometimes the most difficult things to understand when we are in recovery is that those we love may still be stuck in a world we cannot be a part of any more, the world of drink, the world of self harm, the world of abusive behaviour which has become the normal for them. And we want to prove to those still damaged that we love them and cherish them. Sometimes we can love and cherish the people still stuck, but their behaviour is so wrong for us as individuals we need to move away. Loving people and hating their behaviour, loving people and not being able to be with them is all part of acceptance of a new way of life. Acceptance is the good, the bad and the ugly, and a new life sometimes means we leave people behind, letting go with love towards them, even when they may continue to abuse us, hate our new outlook and strike out in the only way they can... With hate...

A phrase I have heard quite often, ""I suddenly realised I was talking to the disease."" When in recovery we say, ""my name is... And I am an alcoholic,"" we own the absolute fact that we are an alcoholic and we have alcoholism. Alcoholism is not separate to the person, it is not something which is going to go away. When we are sober, we talk face-to-face and we are alcoholics in recovery just today. The chattering head, the words spoken when disabled by alcohol and addiction are still our words. Emotional and spiritual well-being is contingent on how we are able to cope with our feelings in the moment and asking for help when we need it from any source and from any direction, and it works just for today. And with each new day, we learn more wisdom and we learn more about our emotional and spiritual condition as we come to believe and understand life in the moment of now...

If we can understand our new direction, to be open, honest and willing, then we stop the blame game. And if we stop the blame game with ourselves and find forgiveness, then we can stop the blame game with everyone else and start to live life on life's terms...

Step four: it may seem like a giant project if it is not broken down. My way of breaking down the fearless moral inventory was to divided up into five-year chunks, simply because I was quite old when I got to step four and when I stopped drinking. In each five-year chunk, there was plenty to be angry and resentful about. State of the nation, the state of my bank balance, the state of my romantic interludes, the state of my career, the fact that drink was always a recipe to take the edge off and fix my feelings, even though I did not realise I was truly fixing my feelings because they were so raw and unhappy with reality...

We all share together, experience strength and hope. And we hear our own story in the words shared by many sober people and we can have hope, and learn life as it can be today...

I was listening to a documentary about survivors of cancer. Once they have the ""all clear"" they are discharged and given a set of recommendations. And the overwhelming news from the survivors: ""people don't understand what we've been through, they don't realise that being cured, or at least in remission, life was changed forever. And we don't know how to live it."" But like all professionals in any field which saves lives, resources are limited and discharge does not mean that people are equipped to deal with life after the life-saving intervention. I have enormous gratitude that two people sat together and worked out that survivors with like experiences might be able to develop a way to learn how to live life and keep safe in recovery one day at a time...

In that picture you can see the sidwalks covered with the homeless, piled up like dead bodies. Many of whom have substance abuse problems. Denver AA meetings:  https://www.denverdonate.com/denver-co-aa-meetings  

Bill Wilson literally smoked himself to death. He died from emphysema and pneumonia. Bill also continued to fight intense cravings for alcohol until the moment he died.

It's been almost 75 years since Alcoholics Anonymous was developed. The principles that Bill Wilson developed for this program were a sign of the times when very little was known about alcoholism and they didn't have much to work with. We now have a much better and accurate understanding of the roots of alcoholism and addiction.  Scientific research now tells us that the roots of alcoholism reside in neurotransmitters in the brain and balancing these neurotransmitters will lead to successful recovery. It is not the result of character flaws, personality disorders, lack of will power or a spiritual disease.

Interviews, recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow. With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A..

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-12-12T00:06:20.000Z","[u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Sexaholics Anonymous', u'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous', u'Gamblers Anonymous', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'Marijuana Anonymous', u'Celebrate Recovery', u'Higher Power', u'God', u'Addiction', u'Recovery', u'12 Step Recovery', u'Speaker', u'NA', u'AA', u'CA', u'OA', u'GA', u'12 step program', u'12 steps', u'Methamphetamine', u'Opiates', u'Marijuana', u'Heroin', u'Abuse', u'Survivors', u'Alcoholism', u'Big Book', u'Basic Text', u'12 and 12', u'Co-dependent', u'Al-Anon']","10","12884","0","6","183"

In the space of two years, he lost his job, his house, and his family. When he finally faced the damaged he had caused in his life and the lives of those he loved, he wondered if there was any hope for the future. Because God helped him make amends, there was.

Step 9 - Wherever possible, make direct restitution to all persons you have harmed.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-07-02T09:19:33.000Z","[u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'AA', u'AA Speaker', u'Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker', u'AA Big Book', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Services', u'aa.org', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Convention', u'Twelve Steps and Twelve traditions', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'xa speakers', u'Bill W', u'Bill Wilson', u'xa', u'wedorecover12', u'we do recover 12', u'carry the message']","6","4854","0","3","48"

Addiction is the participation in a habitual activity or substance that a person seeks out in order to feel relief, but which has more control over a person than a person has over it.

Most of us alive today (given the previous statement) are addicted to something. But obviously there are varying degrees of damage that specific addictive activities or substances do to a person's life. This video is aimed at those individuals who have noticed that their particular addiction is doing damage to themselves and their lives.

In this video, Teal explains that addiction only reinforces powerlessness. She outlines steps that one can take to stop their addiction. And goes on to say that the absolute most important part of recovery is to discover and heal the motivation behind the addiction. Teal explains that addiction is not about the substance or activity that we are addicted to. Addiction is always about what we are trying to run away from, avoid or make ourselves numb to with the addiction.

Until we find and heal what is beneath the addiction (what led us to the addiction in the first place), the motivation for engaging in the addictive substance or behavior will remain. If the motivation remains, the addiction will remain. The person, whose motivation remains, will experience relapse after relapse.

Recovery is not just about removing the substance or activity from our lives, it is about creating a whole new life where we don't even feel the urge to engage in our addiction in the first place.

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-12-05T22:22:20.000Z","[u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Sexaholics Anonymous', u'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous', u'Overeaters Anonymous', u'Gamblers Anonymous', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'Marijuana Anonymous', u'Celebrate Recovery', u'Higher Power', u'God', u'Addiction', u'Recovery', u'12 Step Recovery', u'Speaker', u'NA', u'AA', u'CA', u'OA', u'GA', u'12 step program', u'12 steps', u'Motivational Speaker', u'Methamphetamine', u'Opiates', u'Marijuana', u'Heroin', u'Abuse', u'Survivors', u'Alcoholism', u'Big Book', u'Basic Text', u'12 and 12', u'It works how and why', u'Co-dependent', u'Al-Anon']","11","12186","0","10","93"

When drug dealers threatened his family for information on his location, he knew he had to change. But how could he? Was there any good left in him? In the addiction recovery program, Austin learned the truth: God had given him many good qualities, and He had the power to help Austin uncover them again.

Step 4 - Truth: Make a searching and fearless written moral inventory of yourself.

Directly or indirectly, every community is affected by alcoholism and drug dependence, as is every family. Husbands and Wives, Brothers and Sisters, Children, Parents, Mam and Dad, Relatives and Friends.

Trust me there is hope!! 

I have first hand experience, and at one time was alcohol dependent myself for many, Many years.

We will also be discussing Alcoholic Definition and why people choose to call it a disease when medically its not classed as one? it's simply is not a Decease.
Trust me, there is hope!! 

This Channel has nothing to do with religion nor am I religious in any way.
That's not to say I have anything against religion, as I've witnessed it help a lot of people.
This channel is about what i know to be real. People get dependent on Alcohol and it destroys them, their family's and everything around them. That is very real.!!

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for addiction"" or ""drug abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems... The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

The importance of this video, and all our other videos, are to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

This is the third in a series of videos released by the College to help increase awareness about the CASC examination, and to help candidates prepare better for the clinical assessment. The videos will be useful not only to trainees and other CASC candidates, but also to their trainers as a basis for discussion.

There are millions of us who are in recovery that remain unknown to most of their friends and co-workers. Maybe we should declare ourselves to bring hope to those who are still struggling.
""Deeply entrenched social stigma and mass participation in widely successful anonymous 12-step groups have kept recovery voices silent and faces hidden for decades."" But now, many recovery advocates are beginning to ""come out of the shadows to tell their true stories."" The powerful message of The Anonymous People is conveyed through the faces and voices of the leaders, volunteers, corporate executives and celebrities who are ""coming out"" in order to publicize the epidemic of addiction—and to help other addicts break their silence. This new public recovery movement aims to transform public opinion, change public dialogue around addiction and recovery, and unite the recovery community as a political force.

Transcript:
Avoid H.A.L.T. (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)
If you are hungry, get something to eat. If you are angry, talk to somebody about it. If you are lonely, go to a meeting or call a friend. If you are tired, get a good night’s sleep. Taking care of yourself should be a top priority at any time in your recovery but especially during the festive holidays
Plan each and every day of your holiday season
Plan to spend the majority of your time with friends and family who are supportive of your recovery. Also ensure you spend time with people who are in recovery and are able to support and guide you during times when family and friends may not be able to. 

Find a meeting in your area – 12 - step programs don’t take the holidays off!
Many groups have special meetings during the holidays to share their experience, strength and hope. Check the internet for a meeting in your area. Don’t miss meetings because of the holidays! They are still going on, and in many cases sometimes in greater frequency BECAUSE of the holidays.
Write out a daily gratitude list
The quickest cure to get you out of the holiday blues is by writing a gratitude list. Identifying what you are grateful for helps with eliminating feeling sorry for oneself and connecting with being grateful for what you have gained from your recovery.","UCfs9RqbQIEwn0FNsgLooe6A","2015-11-13T11:46:05.000Z","","0","228","0","0","1"

"GQaOzLReZN8","The Impact On Children Who Parents Are Alcoholics Or Drug Addicts / Educational Video PSA","The Impact On Children Who Parents Are Alcoholics Or Drug Addicts / Educational Video PSA. Children in families experiencing alcohol or drug abuse need attention, guidance and support. They may be growing up in homes in which the problems are either denied or covered up.  These children need to have their experiences validated. They also need safe, reliable adults in whom to confide and who will support them, reassure them, and provide them with appropriate help for their age. They need to have fun and just be kids. Families with alcohol and drug problems usually have high levels of stress and confusion. High stress family environments are a risk factor for early and dangerous substance use, as well as mental and physical health problems. It is important to talk honestly with children about what is happening in the family and to help them express their concerns and feelings. Children need to trust the adults in their lives and to believe that they will support them. Children living with alcohol or drug abuse in the family can benefit from participating in educational support groups in their school student assistance programs. Those age 11 and older can join Alateen groups, which meet in community settings and provide healthy connections with others coping with similar issues. Being associated with the activities of a faith community can also help. Dependence on alcohol and drugs is our most serious national public health problem. It is prevalent among rich and poor, in all regions of the country, and all ethnic and social groups. Millions of Americans misuse or are dependent on alcohol or drugs. Most of them have families who suffer the consequences, often serious, of living with this illness. If there is alcohol or drug dependence in your family, remember you are not alone. Most individuals who abuse alcohol or drugs have jobs and are productive members of society creating a false hope in the family that ""it's not that bad.""  The problem is that addiction tends to worsen over time, hurting both the addicted person and all the family members. It is especially damaging to young children and adolescents. People with this illness really may believe that they drink normally or that ""everyone"" takes drugs. These false beliefs are called denial; this denial is a part of the illness. Alcoholism and other drug addiction have genetic and environmental causes. Both have serious consequences for children who live in homes where parents are involved. More than 28 million Americans are children of alcoholics; nearly 11 million are under the age of 18. This figure is magnified by the countless number of others who are affected by parents who are impaired by other psychoactive drugs. Alcoholism and other drug addiction tend to run in families. Children of addicted parents are more at risk for alcoholism and other drug abuse than are other children. Children of addicted parents are the highest risk group of children to become alcohol and drug abusers due to both genetic and family environment factors. Biological children of alcohol dependent parents who have been adopted continue to have an increased risk (2-9 fold) of developing alcoholism. Recent studies suggest a strong genetic component, particularly for early onset of alcoholism in males. Sons of alcoholic fathers are at fourfold risk compared with the male offspring of non-alcoholic fathers. Use of substances by parents and their adolescent children is strongly correlated; generally, if parents take drugs, sooner or later their children will also. Adolescents who use drugs are more likely to have one or more parents who also use drugs. The influence of parental attitudes on a child's drug taking behaviors may be as important as actual drug abuse by the parents. An adolescent who perceives that a parent is permissive about the use of drugs is more likely to use drugs. Public Service Announcement from SAMHSA in the public domain.

"7vsJMC6iJMg","Sex Addiction Symptoms, Causes and Effects Full Documentary","Sex addiction can refer to a range of behaviors that are done in excess and significantly impact one’s life in a negative way.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V (DSM-5) does not list sex addiction as a diagnosable condition yet, but research indicates that there is a clear prevalence of adverse sexual behavior that is similar in development to a “chemical” addiction.
Is Porn Addiction the Same as Sex Addiction?
Porn addiction and sex addiction are not the same disorder. Addiction to porn is considered to be a type of sex addiction and can manifest itself differently than other types of sex addiction. Like “sex addiction,” “porn addiction” is not an official diagnosis in the DSM-5 yet. However, an addiction to porn can lead to serious distress and consequences in many facets of life.

What are the Signs, Symptoms, and Effects of a Sexual Addiction?
Several signs can serve to indicate whether someone is addicted to sex. These can be emotional or physical. Furthermore, it’s important to know the debilitating effects of sexual addiction.  

Emotional Symptoms of Sex Addiction
If you or someone you love suffers from a sex addiction, you might not have healthy boundaries. If your husband is addicted to porn or sex, you may feel alienated, isolated, depressed, angry, or humiliated and need treatment yourself. If you are addicted to sex, you might become easily involved with people sexually or emotionally regardless of how well you know them, according to Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous. Because most sex addicts fear being abandoned, they might stay in relationships that aren’t healthy, or they may jump from relationship to relationship. When alone, they might feel empty or incomplete. They might also sexualize feelings like guilt, loneliness or fear.

Physical Symptoms of Sex Addiction
Although a sex addiction or pornography addiction can create many physical side effects, few physical symptoms of this disorder exist. However, the most common physical sex addict symptoms you might notice from having a sexual addiction is feeling immobilized due to sexual or emotional obsessions.","UCE7ZHqcomPwY_0bv-ZrUQ7w","2015-12-03T17:11:43.000Z","[u'Sexual Addiction (Film Subject)', u'Addiction (Quotation Subject)', u'Documentary', u'bbc', u'national', u'Future', u'pornography', u'history', u'planet', u'Mars', u'channel', u'National', u'geographic', u'PBS', u'hd', u'Space', u'Aliens', u'pyramids', u'fullhd', u'720p', u'documentaries', u'documentary', u'films', u'full', u'length', u'discovery', u'Nova', u'Sex Tourism (Film Subject)', u'Documentary (TV Genre)', u'Female (Literature Subject)', u'Female Sex Tourism', u'Travel', u'History', u'Adventure', u'Culture', u'Nature', u'Events', u'Destination', u'Museum', u'Cruise', u'Landmark', u'Holiday', u'Europe', u'Visit', u'Cheap', u'Attractions']","0","1902","0","1","2"

If you are currently worried about your drinking you might be hoping that there is a simple tablet that you can take that will make all the pain and misery go away.

Alcohol addiction is a complicated problem for the producers of prescription medication because unlike any other drug addiction it is completely endorsed by society. The chances are good that around 80% of the people you know drink alcohol, and seem to do so without any problems. 

Take heroin or sniff glue and you become a social leper, whereas alcohol is the only drug where that happens when you stop taking it. 

There are very few prescription meds available to help with alcoholism. The oldest and most well known is called Antabuse, which makes the user violently ill if they consume alcohol. 

Naltrexone and Topamax are anti-opiate and anti seizure drugs that are being trailed with alcohol dependant people. They work by removing the ‘high’ from drinking. It is claimed that over time the drinker realises that the consumption of alcohol is not having any effect and stops.

I tried all three of these drugs and found the side-effects were worse than the hangovers. Naltrexone in particular made me feel exceptionally ill, and I hated taking the tablet each day.

The biggest problem with taking prescription medication to help with alcohol addiction is you have to have the discipline to take the tablet. I found that after a while I started allowing myself days off the medication as a reward for ‘a good week’, ‘success at work’, ‘the dog’s birthday’... anything really.  

The only way to really give up alcohol is the change the way you think about it. There is no magic bullet cure – the cure is already in your head.

"TzsaV3-Uj98","Dave P. - NA Speaker - ""Staying Clean Is My Top Priority In Life""","Very entertaining and enlightening talk by Dave P., a GREAT NA speaker! He has a tremendous amount of insight and this tape is very inspiring! 
""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

The Bruno Groening Circle of Friends is an international organization devoted to healing on the spiritual path through the teaching of Bruno Groening (1906-1959).  Bruno Groening was one of those extraordinary people, connecting with the divine  and able to convey an  extremely powerful healing stream.

Spiritual Healing of diseases of all kinds, difficult relationship problems, business and financial problems, finding of lost items – in fact any kind of help, big or small that a person asks for.

In the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends, interested people can learn how to take in healing power free of charge. Often amazing healings happen, even of long-standing organic ailments. Spiritual Healing,  testimony of how Death threatening illnesses have been healed  - medically attested to by thousands worldwide.  

Bruno only asks one to believe in God, and trust that, through the ‘healing stream’ , accessed by a simple seating posture with open hands and uncrossed legs  - and a state of mind in which one ‘gives away’ all worries and ‘burdens’ – gives them to Bruno. ONLY BELIEVE IN GOD -   Bruno urged.

What about Evil? Evil is real, and is evident in our lives – sickness is Evil! The way to be healed is to call on the good, God, and to believe in the power of defeating evil – through asking Bruno deliver Healing from God.

Many years after his ‘going home’ (Bruno’s description of death) the same miracle healing energy  is continuing to heal thousands worldwide today.

During the fifties, Bruno Groening created immense interest the world through his extraordinary healing successes .

He left behind the knowledge of how to take in a spiritual healing power, the ""Heilstrom"". He said, ""Nothing is incurable. God is the greatest physician."" 

All that is needed is to practice a simple energy technique to heal the mind and body, sitting with legs uncrossed and open hands,  a divine force can enter the body – an energy Bruno called the ‘ The Heilstrom’  (Holy Stream).

It is best to learn the teaching through presence of people who have received the healing in Bruno Groening groups in many countries (The Circle Of Friends).  

Being connected to the divine all the time, exercising the teaching twice everyday and meditating regularly in a group is essential. Spiritual Healing testimonies of how this extremely powerful healing stream was responsible for Spiritual Healing of many diseases, mental and physical spiritual healing power healing successes abound.

Bruno insisted that it was God who makes miracles not Bruno. He told people to thank God – not him.

The Circle Of Friends meetings leverage reception of healing forces. Hearing a Spiritual Healing testimony of how others have been helped and healed is in itself extremely powerful.

Meetings can be physical or virtual every three to four weeks. Strong belief that the divine force helps and heals is important. Healing may or may not occur over time, with or without pain (‘Regelungen’), however, persistence is important, although instant healings also abound. See List below www.bruno-groening.org

There is always a limit on the intake of alcohol to make its useful for the human body. Beyond that set limit, it affects the body in a number of ways. Some of the effects that a normal person is aware of are headache, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness for some time, hangovers, loss of muscle control and disorientation etc. However, drink does have some major long term effects on the human body.","UCrWxw09RYZq1CJfI9dSS-iQ","2009-01-25T13:31:04.000Z","[u'Alcohol', u'Addiction', u'Treatmentalcohol', u'detox', u'dietalcohol', u'drugsalcohol', u'effectsalcohol', u'facilitiesalcohol', u'facilityalcohol', u'flori']","21","17380","0","2","33"

Psilocybin-Assisted Treatment for Alcohol Dependence

Michael Bogenschutz, MD

Abstract: This presentation will review past clinical trials of the classic hallucinogens for addiction, discuss possible mechanisms of action, and present the design and preliminary results of an ongoing pilot study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence. Before clinical research with these drugs was halted abruptly in the early 1970s, the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism was studied extensively, with additional studies involving other classic hallucinogens and other addictions. A recent meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials of LSD for treatment of alcoholism (N = 536) demonstrated that the overall effect size of LSD treatment was clinically and statistically significant for up to 6 months after a single high-dose treatment. Candidate mechanisms include: acute objective brain effects, which can be measured at a number of levels; acute subjective effects, including mystical and other highly salient experiences; persisting effects, e.g. on brain structure and function, psychological states such as mood and anxiety, personality traits, beliefs, and values; and final change mechanisms directly related to substance use behavior, such as craving, self-efficacy, and motivation.

Dr. Michael Bogenschutz is Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology and Vice-Chair for Addictions and Clinical Research in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. Dr. Bogenschutz received his BA cum laude from Harvard University in 1985, and his MD cum laude from the joint Harvard/MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program in 1990. He joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico in 1994 after completing his residency in psychiatry at the Cambridge Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. Dr. Bogenschutz has served on many committees and taskforces at the state and national level; has published over 100 articles, chapters, and abstracts; and has served as a reviewer for over a dozen peer-reviewed journals. He has been listed in Best Doctors in America continuously since 1998.

At Psychedelic Science 2013, over 100 of the world's leading researchers and more than 1,900 international attendees gathered to share recent findings on the benefits and risks of LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, ibogaine, 2C-B, ketamine, DMT, marijuana, and more, over three days of conference presentations, and two days of pre- and post-conference workshops.

"_Xq13_vg_qA","Alcohol and Drug Addiction Educational PSA Video","Anti-Alcohol Video PSA. Public domain public service announcement. Alcoholism is a chronic disease that makes your body dependent on alcohol. You may be obsessed with alcohol and unable to control how much you drink, even though your drinking is causing serious problems with your relationships, health, work and finances. It's possible to have a problem with alcohol, but not display all the characteristics of alcoholism. This is known as alcohol abuse, which means you engage in excessive drinking that causes health or social problems, but you aren't dependent on alcohol and haven't fully lost control over the use of alcohol. Although many people assume otherwise, alcoholism is a treatable disease. Medications, counseling and self-help groups are among the therapies that can provide ongoing support to help you recover from alcoholism. Alcoholism is a disease. It is often diagnosed more through behaviors and adverse effects on functioning than by specific medical symptoms. Only 2 of the diagnostic criteria are physiological (those are tolerance changes and withdrawal symptoms). Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are associated with a broad range of medical, psychiatric, social, legal, occupational, economic, and family problems. For example, parental alcoholism underlies many family problems such as divorce, spouse abuse, child abuse and neglect, welfare dependence, and criminal behaviors, according to government sources.","UCB5PUhKvXlxcyU4F575TZAw","2008-07-02T05:26:55.000Z","[u'alcohol', u'substance', u'chemical', u'abuse', u'anti-alcohol', u'anti', u'intoxicated', u'addiction', u'drinking', u'alcoholism', u'use', u'treatment', u'consumption']","11","17142","0","3","16"

He is the first tenured African-American professor in the sciences at Columbia University where he is an associate professor in the psychology and psychiatry departments. He is also a member of the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse and a Research Scientist in the Division of Substance Abuse at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. However, long before he entered the hallowed halls of the Ivy League, Hart gained first hand knowledge about drug usage while growing up in one of Miami's toughest neighborhoods. He recently wrote a memoir titled, ""High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society."" In the book, he recalls his journey of self-discovery how he escaped a life of crime and drugs and avoided becoming one of the crack addicts he now studies.

"kJFcCOXGkck","Chris R. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker ""Big Book Workshop""","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.

Cannabis substitution is a harm reduction strategy which has proven highly successful with many individuals who have had severe problems with alcohol or other drugs. In particular, people who have dangerous withdrawals or episodes of violence when they drink alcohol can benefit from cannabis substitution, as can pain patients who wish to avoid physical dependence on opioid painkillers or people who have had problems with any illicit drug.

Alcohol Addiction - What is alcoholism? 

Alcohol addiction is simply defined as a compulsive need for an intoxicating liquid that is obtained from fermented grain or fruit. These liquids include beer, wine, and other hard liquors. 

Alcoholism is present when a person craves alcohol and cannot limit or contain his or her drinking. If someone experiences withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, sweating, shakiness, or anxiety when alcohol consumption has ceased, or if there is a need to drink greater amounts of alcohol in order to feel a high, that person is most likely alcoholic. 

Some may think that its just a matter of having the will to stop drinking, but alcoholism is more complicated than that. An alcoholics craving for alcohol is so great that it suppresses their ability to stop drinking. The majority of alcoholics need assistance to stop drinking. With treatment and support from family and friends, many have been able to stop drinking and rebuild their lives. It is a sad fact however that there are still some who are unable to stop in spite of these aids.

Alcohol Addiction - What are the causes and effects of alcoholism?
Scientists say that someone who has alcoholic addiction in his/her family is more likely to develop alcoholism if they choose to drink. Alcoholism can also develop or worsen based on a persons environment and traumatic experiences in life. These factors may include culture, family, friends, peer pressures, and the way the person lives. 

Alcoholism can lead people into serious trouble, and can be physically and mentally destructive. Currently alcohol use is involved in half of all crimes, murders, accidental deaths, and suicides. There are also many health problems associated with alcohol use such as brain damage, cancer, heart disease, and diseases of the liver. Alcoholics who do not stop drinking reduce life expectancy by 10 to 15 years.","UCOtSY9g8Eme1zA2vWnOAeDw","2010-05-09T14:49:57.000Z","[u'Alcohol Addiction', u'Biblica', u'Alcoholism', u'Testimony', u'Alcoholism Help', u'Randall Niles', u'You Tube', u'Video']","45","29305","0","13","63"
"itsb6AAUsfs","Alcohol Treatment - Treatment of Alcohol Abuse and Addiction","Alcohol Treatment - Treatment of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. Treatment for alcohol abuse and addiction is similar to other addictions in some ways. 

Addictions are very strong and overcoming them can be hard but with commitment, determination and support you will have the resources available to come through no matter the level of addiction and how impossible it may seem to be. 

Considering the effects of alcohol on your health and your social and economic life will give you all the reason to want to quit. You do not necessarily have to wait until you have the money to go to a rehabilitation center, as some offer financial assistance, and with the right information, you can start getting on the right track immediately.

The first step towards sobriety is the willingness to stop drinking. Are you willing to quit the habit and are you committed in seeing this habit die in your life?

As the saying goes, where there is a will there is a way, and therefore, if the willingness is there, then there is certainly a way out of the problem .The path starts with admitting that you have a problem with drinking. 

Many people who are already in the throes of addiction live in denial and say they aren't hurting anyone. After admitting that you have a problem, then you need to make a decision to stop, or at least be willing to try it, one day at a time. 

This may not happen overnight and may take more than one attempt, but with willingness, you will eventually succeed. You may want to sit down and do an evaluation of the benefits you get from drinking and those that you will get after quitting. 

Also,  write down a list on the costs of drinking in terms of how it has affected your relationships and the benefits you will get after stopping. An example of the costs of drinking may also be things like how you lost your family or the fact that you have a strained relationship with your spouse. 

What you get after quitting may be a restored relationship with your family and spouse. Make a list of five negative things in your life that have resulted from drinking and how you can have them back after stopping. These are some of the things that will motivate you towards doing away with drinking.

The other step in this type of therapy is setting goals in preparation for change. The goals you set should be achievable and time bound. 

Some examples of the goals you may want to set include the date you want to stop drinking. You can also set a goal to stop drinking on weekdays and to drink for only two or three hours during the weekend. 

Keep adjusting the goals, for instance, you can say after two weeks, you will stop drinking on Sundays and drink only for two hours on Saturday, and eventually set a goal to stop completely. 

Write down the goals and be disciplined enough to follow them. Also write down some things that can help you in achieving the goals. 

These may be going for jogging every evening during the time you used to have set aside for drinking. You may also need to change your company and announce your goals to your family and friends who will keep reminding you and help you stick to them

Quitting alcohol may cause some withdrawal effects, some may be mild but others may be severe and may need medical intervention. 

Some of the signs of withdrawal include severe vomiting, fever, hallucinations, extreme agitation, and convulsions, among others. These signs indicate severe withdrawal and you should seek medical attention immediately with any of these.

Sometimes you may need to go for detoxification to remove the toxins accumulated from the intake of alcohol. This will be the case for heavy or long term drinkers. 

You will often get cravings for alcohol, especially during the first month after quitting drinking. You should look for ways to deal with the cravings, which can be sometimes very intense. 

Start by staying away from things that arouse the urge to drink in you. This may call for avoiding certain places, removing everything that reminds you of alcohol from your house or avoiding some parties where you know you will be tempted to drink. 

Also, during these times when you feel the urge, look for something to do that will distract your mind from the craving. You can also get the list you wrote down on why you should stop drink and read it to yourself out loud. 

Another important thing in the recovery path is seeking support, and the right kind. The path may be difficult if you do it alone and therefore seek support for encouragement and support from friends, family, counselors or other people who have walked through the path you are walking and came out successfully.","UC0DjvVv2554_ubhgZ44ExMw","2013-03-18T16:01:42.000Z","[u'alcohol treatment', u'alcoholism treatment', u'alcoholic treatment', u'alcohol rehab', u'alcohol rehabilitation', u'treatment for alcohol', u'alcoholism rehab', u'alcoholism rehabilitation']","0","1515","0","0","0"

""Alcoholism is a family disease. Every alcoholic affects at least four other people, including children, siblings, parents, spouses, partners, friends, and coworkers.  Many people who were exposed to alcoholism in childhood find difficulties with relationships in their adult life. There are often problems with handling fear, anger, guilt, shame, and self-esteem issues.

If you grew up affected by someone else's drinking, Al-Anon is a safe place to bring your concerns, your questions, and your desire to lead a better life.

Brookside Institute offers treatment protocol that combines the latest in neuroscience (TMS Neurofeedback), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medicine to treat addiction and co-occurring disorders (dual diagnosis).

Unlike other treatment centers that may offer ""non 12 step programs"" the Brookside Recovery Protocol ™ is a science-based, medical model that applies over twenty years of scientific research to provide a comprehensive treatment for addiction. Although other treatment programs may claim to be non 12 step, none provide the same level of care and innovative approach to addiction as Brooksides individualized, all-inclusive treatment protocol. Many programs have recently jumped on the non 12 step trend; however, Brookside Institute is the pioneer in science-based, medical model treatment for addiction and has always used this model to treat addiction.

At the Neuroscience Center we use TMS and Neurofeedback as treatment.

Magno-EEG Resonant Therapy (MERT) is an innovative treatment procedure using a noninvasive electromagnetic resonant process to tune up or down specific brainwaves. This is a refined process of the traditional Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) that is unique to Brookside Institute NeuroScience Center. Unlike TMS, MERT is precisely calculated based on the individuals electroencephalography (EEG) to deliver the perfect combination of electromagnetic resonance to bring the brainwave back into balance.

The MERT process begins with a baseline EEG recording to characterize the patients individual brainwave signature. The signature is then used to determine the MERT treatment settings, which include output intensity, stimulus frequency, location, duration and maintenance plan to bring the brainwaves back into normal patterns.

As a second treatment option, Neurofeedback is a revolutionary non-invasive procedure that can improve symptoms of a variety of behavioral disorders, learning disabilities and mental illness. It is a form of biofeedback that presents a patients brainwave activity in real time using a video display technique that allows the patient to learn how to control and change his or her brainwaves to healthier patterns or function. Through several sessions, the patient learns to control objects on the monitor, in essence using his or her mind to play a video game. As the patients brain function improves, the difficulty of the game is increased.

The neurofeedback procedure at Brookside Institute begins by assessing the brain activity, using EEG recorded brainwaves, or brain signals, as it relates to abilities to learn, concentrate and control emotions. This comprehensive analysis is used as a guide to re-train specific areas of the brain using exercises that target the identified brain areas that are compromised.

While we want you to select us because the Brookside Recovery Protocol offers the only science-based, medical model for addiction treatment, we also want our clients to be comfortable and enjoy the surroundings and the climate of Southern California; which can't be beat.

At Brookside Institute we are dedicated to the research and treatment of substance abuse disorders. Our NeuroScience Center is a state-of-the-art facility located in Newport Beach and Irvine, California. Our patients have access to the latest breakthroughs in brain wave function and neurophysiology and the center is designed to provide a comfortable, confidential atmosphere for medical treatment and therapy sessions.

"-33JlmR1Ans","How Substance Abuse and Alcoholism Affects the Family - Reach Recovery","Substance Abuse Recovery in Greenville, NC can be found at http://reachrecovery.org.

There is a common misconception that substance abusers believe. They often think ""I am only hurting myself."" This is not a true belief. In fact, dependency upon chemicals causes one to behave in ways that hurt the people closest to them. It:

1- Dominates the user's thoughts and priorities.
2- Occupies the user's time, money, and attention.
3- Deteriorates the user's values and behavior. 

All of these changes directly affect the whole family and has a negative impact on the family. 

What impact does this behavior have on the family? It creates constant unpredictability. Family members struggle to adapt to the unstable ways of the user: 

1- The non-user begins to develop emotional and physical problems.

2- Family member becomes filled with anger, guilt, shame, hurt, fear, and loneliness.

3- They can suffer from rejection, abandonment, and other forms of abuse.

What's really at stake for the families of substance abuse or alcoholism? Unfortunately, this is a lose/lose situation for everyone. Healthy family relationships are lost.

1- Lack of trust -- brief periods of sobriety do little to lesser tension since the family has learned not to rely upon the addicts promise.

2- Inability to communicate effectively -- families have learned by trial and error not to talk about problems, and their experience with substance abusers and alcoholics have proven to lead to more fights and arguments.

3- Inappropriate coping skills -- the family has lost the ability to deal with emotions in a healthy way. As addiction progresses, family tension & hopelessness increases. Love becomes confounded by feelings of hatred, eventually finding themselves unable to separate the person from the problem.

Can families take back what was lost?
Certainly, families can win in these situations, but it will take work and time. As we've talked about, the natural course for families in these situations is for families to revolve around the chemically addicted, giving them all the attention. The chemically addicted revolves their life around the chemical. The focus of both the user and non-user in the family is wrong. The family member has relinquished control of their lives to the user.  In order to stop this cycle, the family members must regain control of their own lives!

"52t8Da317KA","Sandy B. Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker 2011","From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.

Margie is a wonderful example of the program of Narcotics Anonymous and she tells her story in a way that everyone can relate to.  This tape is a treat, especially for newcomers, as she does a great job outlining the principles of the program. GREAT share!  

""Narcotics Anonymous (NA) describes itself as a ""fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem"" following the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, and it is the second-largest 12-step organization.

As of May 2010 there were more than 58,000 NA meetings in 131 countries.

Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program's success in attracting members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.

    In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
    In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
    In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
    In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
    In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
    In 2007, there were over 25,065 groups holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
    In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries"" From Wikipedia

Recovery without Shame or Stigma: Contributions from the Neuroscience of Addiction

Presented by Dr. Robert Weathers.

The centerpiece of this presentation is dedicated to providing as simple and accessible an introduction to the neuroscience of addiction as possible. But the guiding rationale behind this ongoing project has more direct, clinical implications. Addiction and recovery are unfortunately often hamstrung by personal feelings of shame and cultural attitudes of stigma. In this presentation, we intend to explore in-depth the usefulness of applying up-to-date, evidence-based concepts from neuroscience. The aim is to provide clinical tools for reducing the shame and stigma that so often accompany addiction and recovery --- whether for the client in recovery, his/her spouse and family, and even the therapist. Our specific focus throughout this lecture/dialogue is on summarizing and practically applying recent findings from neuroscience about addiction as an empirically documented brain disease. 


Dr. Bob Weathers is a curriculum developer at California Southern University. He has more than 35 years of experience educating graduate-level clinicians. In addition to having served as the founding clinical director of a local, nationally recognized residential drug and alcohol treatment center for adults, Dr. Weathers has decades of professional experience in providing psychotherapy and coaching to clients presenting with the entire range of clinical issues and concerns. A sought-after speaker and prolific writer, Dr. Weathers’ current research areas of interest focus on reducing shame and stigma in addiction and recovery by means of instructing clients and their families about addiction and the brain.

Mental Heath Videos with Kati Morton","This week I discuss the difference between alcohol and drug abuse versus dependence, and how we can use substances in leu of using our ED or SH. I hear so often that people who struggle with SH or EDs also use alcohol or drugs as another way to cope. We can even recover from our ED or SH and be using drugs or alcohol instead.. so that we really don't find any healthy coping skills, instead we just switch one unhealthy coping skill for another. 

The way to get out of this horrible cycle is to begin journaling, seeing a therapist and joining NA or AA!! Through that we can figure out what it is that we are trying to numb out from or a feeling that we want to ignore. Then we can work the actual issue or cause of our substance abuse. I know it's hard work, but take it one step at a time. We can beat the urges and get back on track to a Healthy Body and a Healthy Mind!!

We were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our Maker, as we understood Him: 

""God, I offer myself to Thee-to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. 

Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. 

Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!""

--- Background ---
According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, over 250 new drugs have been discovered since 2009.

There are so many different psychoactive drugs floating around that people don’t even realize the complex nature of the current situation.

To document our findings, we filmed substance test kit results at music festivals, as well as interviews with harm reduction organizations, law enforcement officials, and distributors of these illicit substances.

We quickly discovered that most of the time people were surprised to find that their bag of drugs was not what they paid for.","UCVGL-1H6tK9PFUrgFkvCtfg","2014-09-04T11:04:30.000Z","[u'whats in my baggie', u""what's in my baggie"", u'documentary', u'drugs', u'drug policy', u'drug test kits', u'substance test kits', u'misrepresented substances', u'mdma', u'molly', u'lsd', u'bath salts', u'synthetic cathinones', u'bunk police', u'hamilton morris', u'vice', u'sean dunagan', u'dea', u'law enforcement against prohibition', u'patrick murphy', u'university of san francisco', u'krystle cole', u'neurosoup', u'diane goldstein', u'missi woolridge', u'dancesafe', u'alexander spit', u'music festival']","2485","1367262","0","232","9069"

"mGRYsY9KmdQ","Sex Addiction Anonymous","Hello, my name is Jack.  I am a recovering sex addict.  I feel uncomfortable talking about this but if it can help someone then it's worth it.  

I have also realized that my addiction comes as a yearning, as if I won't be able to get enough, which makes me think a major portion of my sex addiction is the feeling of starvation.  I have always felt starved, of food, of comfort, of nurturing, of material things, and I have come to terms with those feelings during the years, but my yearning for sex is as if I can't get enough and I need to.  Maybe I focused a lot of my unfulfilled needs into my sex drive and fulfillment.

People exploit those who they see as weak.  I was very weak and my sex weakness was exploited.  I was led to decisions and actions that wasted a lot of time and were not what my personality would have chosen, but were only what my sex addiction weakness saw as agreeable.  But sex addiction comes back to eat you.  I have learned, that as the years progressed I had random encounters and events that were much more destructive.  It was as if I was willingly eating my life away by sex, but also life was setting up disastrous consequences from my sex weakness.  And what is strange is that none of these encounters told me that sex weakness is a problem, they only enabled my addiction, or attempted to exploit it.  It was only evaluating the negative way my life has turned and seeing that a lot of the stupid decisions I made were because of my sex addiction that I finally saw.  If I neglected my sex addiction I don't believe a saving grace would ever stop the cycle.  Which turns a lot of my 'favorite god given encounters' into failings of my decision making, because if they were god given they would have told me many years ago that I had a destructive habit and would have had people that enlightened me to it instead of progressed it.","UCod7ficyB3carjTzSA5-j5Q","2012-11-27T22:47:18.000Z","[u'nympho', u'nymphomaniac', u'sex addiction anonymous', u'fight club sex', u'tyler durden speech', u'tyler durden monologue', u'fight club speech', u'project mayhem', u'god and sex', u'marriage and sex', u'computer porn help', u'sexual urge', u'sex truth', u'jesus truth', u'christian bale sex', u'addiction slavery', u'jupiter sex', u'zeus sex', u'achilles sex', u'hercules sex', u'sex addiction recovery', u'sex addiction help', u'college sex', u'Pornographic Film (Industry)', u'next stage of life', u'future evolution', u'parents sex']","2","793","0","1","1"

Transcript excerpt:
We are just going to jump in and dive in today on part two of alcoholism. I want to bring up Candace, our co-host and Vicki Johnston, our special guest. Let's give them a hand! Praise God for them! Love you Vicki! I am so glad you have joined us. Let's have a seat and just jump on in to this on this gorgeous fall day. We have been talking about addictions and I know that last week we went back over  alcohol and then tobacco before that.

Today we are going to go over a little bit of everything today. Right, Vicki? Okay? Why don't you go ahead and get started on your testimony?

Well, I started with illicit drug and alcohol and cigarette abuse really at the age of thirteen and continued on until I was thirty. I almost died of alcohol poison while I was a junior in high school. Honestly went on to see others in an overdose type of situation on drugs...close to death. Willing to walk away...

All during the high school time?

And even after. So it was very hard core from the very beginning. 

And you were saying that your parents...they were well-to-do....that that was not it. It was more staying at home. You said loneliness...

I was lonely and just really looking to want to fit in. They did not really have a problem with alcohol or anything but generational maybe did not know a whole lot about my family's size. They were long distant family so I was not super close to them. On my family's side. Went on years and years of that of torture and torment and anger and hopelessness and just honestly wanting to die really young. 

I can remember in high school just wanting to end it all all the time. Did not know what to do with any of that or where to turn or where to go. Just continued on...I do not know really how I survived. I do not know how...

I married at...wow it has been eighteen years. I guess around twenty-three or somewhere in there we married. That was meeting in a bar and going to the kind of bars...being the well-to-do...just the drug and alcohol abuse...it was very scary that it would come from that kind of background. Then I would end up living in a shack or we would go to the bars that they would say to us, ""You must not be from around these parts because you still have all your teeth!"" It got very ugly. Honestly, at thirty I was so hopeless. We were a one-income family. I did get the privilege of getting to stay home with my son when he was born. So he must have been around two at the time. I was very scared, Gwen. I was very, very angry with a two-year old innocent child. It really scared me to death that I could be so angry with him. Very, very hopeless still. I knew that there was a problem and I would kind of mention my problems along the way. Even in high school, I felt like I needed to see a psychiatrist. I just knew that I wanted to die. 

Something was wrong. You did not know how to fix it.

Right! So just to even mention it to family because nobody knew how to deal with that. It just was really ignored. Just did not know where to turn or where to go. It even came to a point in marriage...the one-income family not being able to afford to go to any kind of counseling or go anywhere and so I really got to that place of being so sick of suffering that I really felt done with sin and I started crying out to God. I did not have religion or anything in my life or a church upbringing. I started crying out to God just because I was so miserable and so hopeless and every night I would just go, ""God, please, please just do not let me drink and smoke tomorrow."" Then the next day would come and I would be doing the same thing and every night I was just going to bed miserable...crying myself to sleep. I was always praying and would end my prayers, ""Thank You, God! I love you! Amen."" I felt like I was praying that prayer for about two months, when one particular night right when I said, ""I love You"" from my head to my toe I just had this feeling...
Yes! I remember ""There is a God!"" and the very next night when I said ""I love You"" I got the same feeling again. It was incredible. It was just overnight like ""Wow!"" There is a God and what should I do now?

How about addictiions such as porn pornography, gambling, drinking, alcoholism, smoking chronic weed, pot, or even cigarettes addiction, addictions?
(PT-1) BREAKING FREE FROM DRUG, ALCOHOL OR ANY ADDICTION THAT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY PRICE TAG! 
Millions of people have found that there is a true way out from drug, alcohol or any addiction! Jesus Christ is the answer to have victory over any addiction, and He can and will break any bondage! Millions of people, some rock bottom, some rich as can be, have all but one same testamony as to how they overcame their addiction(s) = Jesus Christ - whether they believed in Him at the time or not, but millions all hold the same testamony that they have been ""Set Free"" by Jesus Christ - because there was nothing mankind had to offer that would, break their addiction for good, except the love of Jesus Christ!
I am also one of them, with the same testamony! AND I am 100% convienced that there is NOTHING stronger than any addiction EXCEPT the Holy Spirit of God !!!  
I nor any other am trying to persuade you into anything. I am simply letting you know that there is a true way out from any addiction or bondage, and that is merely by simply turning to Jesus Christ and asking Him for help!

'Hello, I'm Joyce. I am 71 next week. I had a very bad alcohol problem. I was drinking two or three bottles of whiskey a week. I was tired all the time. I nearly lost my family. My daughter said she was not going to come and see me if I did not pack-up. My husband has been wonderful. He has tried to be fair with me, he has tried to be firm with me, he has tried to be loving. He has tired everything he could to help me but I just could not help myself. Anyway, I saw this advert in the Journal and I came last week for the first time and oh, what a difference it's made. I am sleeping better, eating better, I haven't touched a drink. Yesterday I went down to the shops and there was a bottle of whiskey and I thought I love a drink but then I thought, No, I am not going to let people down.' And as Shokat says, I would be letting myself down. We don't argue my husband and I, but he has been cross with me and we have not had one cross word this week and he said, It's been one of the best weeks for years that we had together.' I used to pass out  I think that was because of the drink. I was sick a lot of the times because of what I was doing to my body. I have only been once and I feel wonderful. Birmingham, UK.

drug and alcohol addiction

There is such a high recidivism (relapse) rate with the common addiction recovery programs. The expensive and short-term recovery centers and methods are recognized on a national level as having many problems. Scientific research reveals that many addictions cause an enduring change in the brain and requires management, not acute treatment.

Website: http://truthofaddiction.com/special/
YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TruthOfAddiction1
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialTruthOfAddiction

William L. White, a senior researcher at Chestnut Health Systems put it simply:

“Treating alcohol and other drug dependence solely through repeated episodes of detoxification and brief stabilization is clinically ineffective and constitutes a poor stewardship of personal and community resources…”

White also believes that we need to make a “shift that will deemphasize expensive, high intensity acute care and emphasize lower-intensity, lower cost and more enduring recovery support services.”

There are evidence-based techniques that have been proven repeatedly to produce successful outcomes, but many of these techniques are not used.

Instead of throwing addicts in a rehab facility for a few weeks or months, the focus needs to be switched to showing recovering addicts how to properly manage their cravings,  how to react to triggers and about the nutrition that helps rebalanced the brain.

Another notable problem with some of the popular treatment options, is that relapse is often treated as a sign of defeat, instead of a part of the recovery process. There probably couldn’t be a more harmful doctrine to an addict than to think that all the days, weeks or months of sobriety didn’t mean a thing because he slipped.

For most people, relapse is a stepping stone through recovery. And studies confirm this. Research indicates that relapses are generally not caused by physical cravings as once thought, but by emotional states. This reveals the great progress the addict has actually made.

The current doctrine of relapse is so harmful because when the addict feels he needs to start all over again, it feeds despair, stress and other emotions that have shown to greatly increase addiction problems.

The truth is that the brain has gone through small but significant changes during a period of abstinence. In the case with alcoholics, one study showed that some brain changes, such as cell regeneration, occurred only after a couple weeks after sobriety.

Recovery is more like climbing a hill. If you slip and fall, you don’t fall all the way to the bottom, you just fall back a few feet, get up and continue climbing.

One more notable problem with common recovery centers are things called cross-addictions. For example, you may find in some treatment groups that recovering alcoholics are smoking a lot or narcotic addicts in recovery are drinking.

The reward center in the brain that is activated by these addictions doesn’t mind if you go to a rehab program as long as “it” gets the needed boost of dopamine. Scientists use the term “common neural currency” to describe how nearly all addictions are the same. Whatever it is, it results in a boost of dopamine. Addictions is really a chemical addiction, regardless of your drug of choice.

The brain of an addict will actually trigger a “partial” reward (spike of dopamine) during the anticipation or sight of the addictive material- which can trigger cravings. It doesn’t matter what the addictive material is. Dr Anna Rose puts it, “you are given a taste of the drug itself.4” It is a powerful primer that perpetuates the cravings leading to more addictive behaviors.

With the advent of casinos in most major centers, and the relatively recent phenomenon of online gambling, a quietly insidious poison is edging its way into the psyches of an increasing number of families:  problem gambling.  Family courts are seeing more and more cases where a spouse's gambling addiction has led to the financial and emotional ruin of the family unit.  Why do some people develop addictive personalities?  How do gambling addictions develop, and what can be done to prevent and treat them?

Guests:
Dr. Richard Wood - Psychologist 
http://gamtalk.org/
Dr Richard Wood is a psychologist who, for the last 18 years,  has been studying the causes of problem gambling and how it can be prevented. Dr Wood also developed, and now manages,  GamTalk a free online support service for people with gambling related issues, to get information and discuss their problems anonymously with others who are going through the same experiences.

Chris Parlow - Pathological Gambler In Remission 
Chris Parlow is a pathological gambling addict whose illness is in remission. Chris now speaks on the illness of gambling addiction and the possibilities for treatment and recovery. The former president of the United Steelworkers Union in Manitoba, Chris struggled with his compulsive gambling and depression for over twenty years in secret. As his compulsion intensified, he began to have trouble paying his bills, eventually declaring bankruptcy, losing all of his possessions and severing all his relationship ties. This culminated when he bet and lost the last eighteen dollars he had and attempted to commit suicide. After this failed suicide attempt, Chris began his recovery at the Parkwood Treatment Centre run by the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba.
Chris has been published in and interviewed by newspapers such as the New Westminster Leader, the Winnipeg Free Press and the Thompson Citizen about his struggle with gambling addiction, and continues to speak to media on the need to reduce the stigma, consequences and risks associated with the illness.

"StU5Tphe0Xc","12-Step Programs For Sex Addiction","http://lukeford.net/blog/?p=36642 There is Sexaholics Anonymous. This group is strict. It stands for no pre-marital sex. No masturbation. No extra-marital sex. It is guys struggling to stay faithful to their wives. The group has a strong Christian overtone but in the big cities you will find Orthodox Jews there because it has a similar morality to Orthodox Judaism.
Then there's Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA). All men. All men who have problems with specific behaviors. They're addicted to porn or to strippers or to hookers or to chasing underage girls or to exposing themselves to strangers.

There's Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. It is mainly men having problem with compulsive sexual patterns such as molesting kids or exposing themselves or committing other sex crimes and the like. It's similar to SAA.

Then there's Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA). This is men and women dealing with their problems with sex and love in relationships. SLAA is the most relationship-oriented of the 12-step sex addiction programs.

Unlike Sexaholics Anonymous, in Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous, you set your own bottom line behaviors you want to abstain from. These 12-step program don't decree to you at the outset that you must give up porn or masturbation or pre-marital sex or strippers or whatever.","UCEYmda1KQTjrhLBeWutKuGA","2011-09-19T02:59:54.000Z","[u'sex addiction', u'12 step programs', u'addict', u'love', u'lust']","0","2727","0","1","10"

The ""I Decide Meditative Movement"" can be added to your daily routine to help you with your recovery.  Overcoming your addiction whether that is to alcohol, cigarettes, drugs or codependency patterns takes effort.  By practicing this simple movement, you exercise your body as you retrain your mind to accept this truth.  Recovery is possible.  You can use these powerful yet simple movements to help you through the tough times.  

Ellie Peterson, creator of Meditative Movements, was divorced at the age of 23 with a 5, 3, 1 year old making $80 a week.  She was introduced to Alanon after her first husband entered a treatment program.  As a co-dependent, she learned how to implement the 12 Steps and they were the bedrock for her own recovery.
The book, You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay, was another healing resource.  It helped her understand that while hurtful things occurred in her childhood, she could move past them.  She didn't need to turn to an addiction to numb the pain.  This was her first introduction to affirmations.  Through her healing journey, she used the affirmations to help her quit smoking but then started gaining weight.  Instead of using food to quiet her fears or returning to smoking because of the weight gain, she combined core value affirmations with physical movements as a way to release her anxiety and stress.  It worked and Meditative Movements was the result.

In recent years, a small amount of hackers and gamers have been anonymously reporting fake hostage situations, shootings, and other violent crimes designed to send elite police units, like SWAT teams, to unsuspecting people at their residences.

Swatting is a dangerous and expensive prank, which is easy to pull off. Swatters are utilizing easily accessible technology to mask or even alter the ID during calls to 911 dispatchers. With SWAT teams and paramilitary gear becoming the norm across small town America, these calls have predictably chaotic results.

Despite the hyper-vigilance of America's law enforcement, authorities still struggle to defend themselves from the unlikeliest of threats — tech-savvy teenagers. Police militarization meets hacker culture as VICE News investigates the dangerous crime of swatting.

LYRICS

Sometimes you’ve got to bleed to know,
That you're alive and have a soul,
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She’s the tear in my heart, I’m alive,
She’s the tear in my heart, I’m on fire,
She’s the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I’ve ever been.

The songs on the radio are ok,
But my taste in music is your face,
And it takes a song to come around to show you how.

She’s the tear in my heart, I’m alive,
She’s the tear in my heart, I’m on fire,
She’s the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I’ve ever been.

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,
But that’s ok, I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,
I’m driving here I sit, cursing my government,
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.

Sometimes you’ve got to bleed to know,
That you're alive and have a soul,
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She’s the tear in my heart, I’m alive,
She’s the tear in my heart, I’m on fire,
She’s the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I’ve ever been.

My heart is my armor,
She’s the tear in my heart, she’s a carver,
She’s a butcher with a smile, cut me farther,
Than I’ve ever been.","UClVrJwcIy7saPcGc1nct80A","2015-04-06T03:23:27.000Z","[u'twenty one pilots', u'tear in my heart', u'blurryface', u'fueled by ramen', u'tyler joseph', u'josh dun', u'jenna joseph', u'jenna black', u'music video', u'video', u'music', u'TOP', u'21 pilots', u'FBR']","15190","35862997","0","5724","276540"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

"0-G5mC5WTDY","Inside Britain's Highest Security Psychiatric Hospital (FULL Documentary)","“Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it’s very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It’s much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.” Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director. Broadmoor, the most famous high secure hospital in the world, has allowed unprecedented access to television cameras for this new two-part ITV documentary. For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"

For the first time in its 150 year history, the viewing public will see the innermost parts of this iconic institution in this two part series. The hospital in Berkshire, often mistaken for a prison, helps treat severely mentally disordered patients many of whom are violent offenders. It’s best known for its high profile patients such as Charles Bronson, Ronnie Kray, Peter Sutcliffe and Kenneth Erskine. Filmed over the course of a year, with extensive access to the hospital, the programmes paint a picture of life inside Broadmoor for both staff and patients. It’s the first time that patients have been allowed to tell their stories themselves and cameras follow patients while they meet psychiatrists, open up about their violent backgrounds, visit the hospital shop and participate in workshops.

In the first programme, cameras are present when one patient refuses medication and it has to be forcibly administered. Another patient with a history of violence on the intensive care ward refuses to return to his room and has to be physically restrained and moved by staff. In one interview, a patient reveals he has never been able to articulate the details of his violent offence and another man speaks about his frighteningly abusive childhood during a session with his psychiatrist. Interviews with staff reveal that on high dependency wards violent incidents occur every other day. For patients in Broadmoor there is no fixed term for their stay so although it is hard to be committed there, it is even harder to get out. 35% of men come from prison, 35% from the court system, 25% from medium secure psychiatric units and 5% from other high-secure hospitals.

In the second programme, a patient describes his life as ‘satanic’ and shares details of his neglected and abusive childhood, and another patient who has spent over a decade in Broadmoor is considered finally well enough to leave. Cameras follow patients taking part in a group drugs counselling session and capture staff taking part in riot training. For many people, Broadmoor is seen as a place to house the country’s most violent criminals but one of its roles it to try to rehabilitate patients.","UCUFDFH-3ZlLkzkFt8CrVHeQ","2015-01-20T15:43:31.000Z","","2778","2609820","0","589","7206"
