"pfgvngQbMMY","Don M. - AA Speaker - ""Feelings are NOT Reality!""","Don M. takes on the topic of ""feelings"" in this AA Speaker tape. One of the things many people in recovery struggle with, is being prey to our feelings as well as being propelled to sometimes making the wrong decisions due to our emotional state.  Don does a GREAT job of telling his story and a mini-workshop on feelings in sobriety.  Why this topic is so important is that when we get sober, it is often the first time we have actually FELT emotion without pouring a bunch of drugs and alcohol on it.  Thanks for the share Don! :)

I love how Adam relates his story and his journey to recovery.  This tape is full of laughs, but carries a strong message of hope and inspiration for us all! Sit back, relax, and enjoy! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Bob D. has such an enlightening and entertaining way of explaining the twelve traditions, the tape seems to fly by! Yes, this one is a MUST LISTEN! Enjoy :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site (And as should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other 12 step program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.)

""Addiction treatment"" WORKS! There is addiction help out there and ""addiction recovery"" is possible.  If you are battling ""alcohol addiction"" there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!  

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-12-05T22:22:20.000Z","[u'Narcotics Anonymous', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'Sexaholics Anonymous', u'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous', u'Overeaters Anonymous', u'Gamblers Anonymous', u'Cocaine Anonymous', u'Marijuana Anonymous', u'Celebrate Recovery', u'Higher Power', u'God', u'Addiction', u'Recovery', u'12 Step Recovery', u'Speaker', u'NA', u'AA', u'CA', u'OA', u'GA', u'12 step program', u'12 steps', u'Motivational Speaker', u'Methamphetamine', u'Opiates', u'Marijuana', u'Heroin', u'Abuse', u'Survivors', u'Alcoholism', u'Big Book', u'Basic Text', u'12 and 12', u'It works how and why', u'Co-dependent', u'Al-Anon']","11","12180","0","10","93"

This tape, which is a little bit shorter than most of ours, is designed to lift anyone's spirits in a fifty minute span.  I have listened to this talk a few times to ""recharge my batteries"" and Clint always touches my heart.  I get something new out of it each time I listen.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Her story really highlights the point that the cessation of our drinking is only the beginning.  She has a wonderful energy and enthusiasm!  

I had the pleasure of meeting her and her husband Charlie a few years ago and they were absolutely delightful.  After an incredibly long day of speaking and workshops, they were heading out of the hotel at about 10:30 or so.  I stopped to thank them real quick and they talked to me for about 15 minutes even though they were tired and worn-out from a long day.  They were SO warm and caring even under a great amount of fatigue! Such wonderful examples of living the program and incorporating it in to every aspect of their lives! Thank you so much Katie and Charlie!

As usual, Earl is on fire with his hilarious sense of humor and his sharp wit.  This is a very insightful and provocative talk! Highly recommended and very entertaining!

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there! :)

"O9hG3M3PNVI","Sandy B. - AA Speaker - ""Spirituality: The Key Component of Alcoholism Recovery""","The rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous are filled with people at various lengths of sobriety, various societal statuses and are in general, a mixed bag of all different kinds of people.  Yet, there is one factor that binds us all together, our common spiritual solution.  Sandy B. from Florida shares a thought-provoking and enlightening talk about how closely spirituality is weaved in to our recovery process.  This tape will SURELY give you a ""pick me up"" if you are feeling down, and will inspire you to put more emphasis on your walk in AA if you are doing great.  There really is something in this talk for EVERYONE, and you won't regret listening to it, this is a MUST listen! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

In this tape, Chris R. deals with this misnomer directly and encourages the audience to think about those things in a different light.  The grace of our Higher Power is not something we should put a damper on, or hide, because we are afraid someone will mock us or say something that might discount what we are saying.  I LOVE how Chris is so direct and sincere.  His experience rings true for SO many members of AA and he is an absolute joy to listen to.  Prepare to be inspired and motivated!

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her ""alcohol abuse treatment.""  ""Substance abuse"" is a very serious condition.  Many need inpatient stays or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

Hats off to Clancy for taking this topic on and explaining it in the most concise, eloquent way possible! :)

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there! :)

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Bob has such a gift at communicating and he is extremely good at relaying his introspection.

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

This workshop features two of the all-time best AA speakers, Mark H. from Texas and Joe H. from California.  They really go in to the depth and weight of the program and it is a VERY moving workshop.  One of my favorite parts is when they get to the 11th step and Mark and Joe share in the most detail I have ever heard them share regarding their spiritual experiences.  Joe H. tells his FULL story about his travels to India and it is absolutely amazing.  Prepare to be disturbed, to laugh, to cry, and most importantly, have a new experience in your own recovery. :)

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.","UCB-DbCrFPZKT94xYE46R9Dw","2013-07-02T09:19:33.000Z","[u'Alcoholics Anonymous (Organization)', u'Alcoholism (Disease Or Medical Condition)', u'Alcoholics Anonymous', u'AA', u'AA Speaker', u'Alcoholics Anonymous Speaker', u'AA Big Book', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Services', u'aa.org', u'Alcoholics Anonymous World Convention', u'Twelve Steps and Twelve traditions', u'12 steps', u'xa speaker', u'xa speakers', u'Bill W', u'Bill Wilson', u'xa', u'wedorecover12', u'we do recover 12', u'carry the message']","6","4852","0","3","48"

Addiction treatment WORKS! The Twelve Step Model has been utilized as a treatment for alcohol abuse and alcoholism since 1935. It is extremely important to know that help IS out there and addiction recovery is possible.  If you are battling alcoholism, drug addiction, addiction or any other form of addictive behavior, there are people who know EXACTLY what it is like!

You can find out more at: http://www.aa.org - Alcoholics Anonymous Official Site - As should be blatantly obvious, we are in no way affiliated with them or any other Twelve Step Program.  We are just looking to provide hope to those suffering from alcoholism or addiction.

It is important to note there are several ways for one to address his or her alcohol abuse treatment. Substance abuse is a very serious condition and has become an epidemic in today's world.  Many people suffering with substance abuse need treatment, such as inpatient stays, rehab, or counseling.  The importance and purpose of this video, and all our other videos, is to show that recovery IS possible and to give hope to those who are struggling with alcohol and drug addiction issues.  Help IS out there! 

From the book Alcoholics Anonymous: ""In spite of the great increase in the size and span of this Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

The life-changing process of the Twelve Steps of AA can bring about a powerful and transformational healing experience.  Steps 4 and 5 are extremely helpful in this process and a critical point in the recovery process.  Polly absolutely nails it with this AWESOME share!

Each day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience, strength, and hope.""

What is the Twelve Step Model? How is it a ""treatment for alcoholism"" or ""alcohol abuse?""

From Wikipedia: ""A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles (accepted by members as 'spiritual principles,' based on the approved literature) outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems. Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939. The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs. Twelve-step methods have been adopted to address a wide range of substance-abuse and dependency problems.""

Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.""

One of the things about the 12th step is that sometimes we tend to overlook it, even if we are sponsoring new people and are very active in service work.  Also, sometimes speaker tapes on Step 12 aren't exactly our most popular.  However, we have about the best one you can listen to right here!  

Scott gives a wonderful summation of Step 12 and shares what an absolute honor and blessing it is to carry the message of recovery!  He tells some great stories about 12-step calls as well as how he came to hear about the life-saving spiritual solution to the illness of alcoholism! GREAT share! :)

This was recorded at the 4th International Convention in Toronto, Canada in July of 1965

From Wikipedia:  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio. AA states that its primary purpose is ""to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety"".  With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development. AA's Twelve Traditions introduced in 1946 to help be stable and unified while disengaged from ""outside issues"" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, avoiding affiliations with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that those representing AA steer clear of dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.
AA has no opinion on the medical nature of alcoholism; nonetheless AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the disease theory of alcoholism.  AA is credited with helping many alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.  The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment. AA's data show that 36% are still attending AA a year after their first meetings.
The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939.  AA membership has since spread ""across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values"", including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroot movements.  In the Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous (November 2001) it states ""Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide membership of AA has just about doubled, to an estimated two million or more..."" 
AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called ""The Big Book"", originally titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism.
